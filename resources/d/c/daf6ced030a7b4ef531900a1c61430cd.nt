The Spanish word arpillera derives from an old Spanish word for burlap. They are sometimes called cuadros (squares). Most arpilleras are used as pictures and hung on walls. The most famous arpilleras and arpilleristas (the women who make them) are from Chile.\r\nArpilleras, or cuadros, depict daily-life events of the women and men (arpilleristas part of the Agrupación de los Familiares de los Detenidos Desaparecidos—AFDD) who have sewn them, and are largely aimed at denouncing the social injustices and violence experienced by the people of Chile during the Pinochet regime (1973-1990). As criticism of Pinochet increased, the government made it illegal to own or publically show arpilleras in the country.\r\nArpilleristas make their arpilleras with scrap material, they embroider and sew it on burlap. They are cheap to make and do not require high technical skills, thus people from all social backgrounds can make arpilleras. The cloths are mostly embroidered in a communal setting, sharing one's story with the others not only through the cloth, but also verbally by narrating one's experience.\r\n\r\nat the top a typical Chilean hilly landscape; in the centre we see a chained hand, whose chains are linked to various industrial activities grouped around it: a facotry on the apper left corner; on the lower left corer we have a house; on the other side (lower right) we can see what looks like a construction site; lastly on the upper right side we see a mining factory.Interpretations of this arpillera could be different: the scene might be representative of people's obligation to work jobs they do not like; it might be an indication of people's diffiucltiy finding or keeping a job; it could also represent the daily enslavement of a monotonous reality in which you go from home to work, and vice-versa." .
