<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/2b6f01b78e78a137a270d058d8d22ecb> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "In 2007 Fiona Pardington first became aware that the Mus√©e de l'Homme in Paris held life casts of her Kai Tahu ancestors, among an extensive series made by the phrenologist Dumoutier during Dumont d'Urville's second Pacific voyage of 1837-40. The scientific parties on most voyages of exploration included artists who depicted lslanders with more or less attention to physique, but d'Urville had special interests in physical anthropology and phrenology that generated this unique and haunting group of voyage relics; the series included casts of the navigator himself and his family. The product of a colonial, racial science, these works also carried the personal identities, even the life forces, of real ancestors. Each individual was named, and in some cases names are accurate, if mistranscribed; in other cases the phrenologist or someone else, imposed names such as 'Faustino' or 'Sambo' which were clearly not derived from the culture of those who had been persuaded to sit. Occupying an uncertain situation between portraiture and physical anthropology, between the commemorative and the clinical, the life casts are irreducibly disturbing, but nevertheless susceptible to being reclaimed through Pardington's imposing photographs. The artist has written: 'Initially it was quite a shock to see so many long rolling cupboards full of casts, everyone was mixed up in a way we wouldn't expect in New Zealand: death and life casts. children, criminals, the insane, people afflicted by extreme medical ailments ... walking down the rows to find my tipuna, Piuraki and Takatahara, was a revelation ... one of the most intense moments of my life.' \r\n(Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts p.308)" .
