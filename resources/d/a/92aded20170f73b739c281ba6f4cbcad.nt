Aan de andere zijde is een landschap in reliëf geperst. De voorstelling is die van bergen rond een baai, waarop de voorgrond onder meer drie masten van groot westers schip te zien zijn. Voorts zijn in het landschap twee gebouwen en een man in een sloep in zilver en groen uitgelicht.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of different inks often categorized by color; most are black, of course, with a slight blue or red tinge, but colored inks are also made in the form of ink-sticks and ground in inkstone wells just like ink. \r\n\r\nIngredients used in ink-sticks can vary, but the basic components are soot made from scorched rapeseed, sesame, camellia, or soybean oils, a glue manufactured from deer hides or other animal parts (agyo), fragrance, and carbon black. In some cases, the soot from the dead branches and roots of pine trees and ground pine is used instead of soot from scorched oils. Agyo, the glue used to manufacture ink, is made by boiling the hides, tendons and cartilage of cows, horses, deer, fish and the like for a long period of time. Fragrances are attained from animals, as in the case of musk, or from various plant or tree barks, and herbs. In modern times, various petroleum products and man-made substances, such as carbon black, have been used together with agyo. However, the best ink-sticks are made from traditional ingredients such as pine or oilsoot. \r\n\r\nThe preparation and application of ink are crucial and vary widely according to the date of ink manufacture, the inkstone, water and paper used, and, of course, the user.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, color can vary from pure black to reddish or bluish tones. Generally, a glossy black ink with a slightly purple or blue tinge is considered the best. And most people agree the lighter weight the ink-stick, the better. This is because an agyo compound with strong adhering power is more effective and therefore can be used in smaller quantities. Once the ink-stick is dried, it is very light if the agyo content is relatively low. Local temperature and humidity factors are probably the reason why Chinese ink-sticks usually contain a 100 : 120 combination of soot and agyo. The relatively heavy use of poor quality agyo accounts for both their weight and tendency to crumble with changes in climate. Korean ink-sticks, on the other hand, contain less agyo, although more than Japanese ink-sticks, and are generally considered lighter and of superior quality. Quality is closely related to the water content of the ink-stick as well as the drying period. The longer an ink-stick is dried, the better. \r\n\r\nKoreans often say ink should be as clear and pure as a child's eyes. The best ink is made by placing a small amount of water in the ink-stone well and rubbing the ink-stick slowly back and forth for a long time. One should only make as much ink as one will use in one sitting. Of course, the amount of water added depends on how the ink is to be used. More water is needed for ink used in shading. \r\n\r\n\r\nInk-sticks are only produced at certain times of the year because the agyo has to be melted and mixed with the soot at just the right temperature and humidity. Preservatives are not used in the better quality ink-sticks. The drying process is extremely sensitive so ink-sticks are never made in summer, and high quality ink-sticks cannot be made in winter since they must be dried naturally and never allowed to freeze. The period from mid-October through April is considered the best time to manufacture ink-sticks." .
