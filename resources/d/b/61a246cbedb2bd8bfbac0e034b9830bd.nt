The Hopis call it tcikwanpi, which means shaft straightener, with the prefix ahl if made out of horn. Horns of mountain sheep and buffalo were traditionally used, later also horns from domesticated goats. Other arrow shaft straighteners were made from stone, bone, antler or wood. This tool was also used for aligning spindles and fire drills. The holes, often of different sizes, were burned into the material. Arrow shafts made from willow, oak or wild currant were then pushed, twisted and drawn through these (progressively smaller) holes, thus straightening them by removing any unevenness and smoothing the surface, resulting in a straight and round arrow shaft, required for exact shooting. The arrows were shot with short sturdy bows made from oak or shadblow (Stevenson 1883:396, fig. 576; Hough 1919:287-288, plate 46; Whiting 1939:23-24; Wright 1979:50-51).\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)" .
