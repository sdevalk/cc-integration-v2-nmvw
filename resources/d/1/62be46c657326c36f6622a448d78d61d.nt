<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7213-8> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This silver box was produced in early 20th century Iran. It is an example of modern silver production in Khuzestan by Marsh Arabs and tells the story of the transition to modernity in Iran in the early 20th century.\r\nThe design is taken from European designs which became popular in the 19th century. These types of objects, such as tea spoons and hair brushes, are part of a shift to a modern way of life adopted from European habits. It also includes symbols of the Marsh Arabs that arose during the formation of modern nation states in the Middle East.\r\nThe other important symbol on this Marsh Arab objectsis the arch of Ctesiphon, an ancient building which still stands outside of Baghdad. This palace was built by the Iranian Sassanian dynasty in the 6th century CE. In the modern period, it was a contested symbol between the Arabs and Iranians. The marsh Arabs were displaced after the First Gulf War, when Saddam Hussein drained the marshes to fight against the Shia population.\r\nThe silver works made by the Marsh Arabs are particularly unique.\r\nSilverwork is one of the most important crafts in Iranian history. Silver is mined in many places in Iran and since ancient times many parts of the world, including Europe, have traded with Iran for its silver." .
