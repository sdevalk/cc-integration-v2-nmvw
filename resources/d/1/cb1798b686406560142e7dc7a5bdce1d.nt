Signed: Hiroshige ga, published by Sanoya Kihei (Kikakudo), ca. 1835-38.\r\nWoodblock print, horizontal oban, 242 x 371\r\nRMV 1353-388\r\n\r\nAfter the Meireki Fire of 1656 – causing the death of more than 100.000 inhabitants and devastating almost 60 percent of the city, various measures were taken to prevent another such disaster. This not only led to the construction of Ryôgoku Bridge across the Sumida River (see Cat. 154), it was also decided that most temples and shrines had to leave the centre of the city. The major ones to remain were the Zôjôji Temple in the south, and the Sensôji Temple in the Asakusa District in the north. Also known as Kinryûzan, it still remains as a most popular temple dedicated to the bodhisattva Kannon, and to be accessed through two impressive gates, the Kaminarimon and the Niomon, with numerous shops in between. On the occasion of the New Year crowds gather to pray and buy papers telling their chances for the coming year." .
