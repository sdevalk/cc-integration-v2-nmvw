<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/TM-60059666> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This stereograph shows Mary's Well in Nazareth, where Catholic tradition holds that the Annunciation took place - the moment when the Angel Gabriel appeared to the Virgin Mary to tell her she would bear the Son of God. Versions of this photograph, always showing a woman holding a jar, were popular tourist collectables for European visitors to the Holy Land. These photographs often tried to connect living Palestinians with Biblical narratives. This stereograph would give the illusion of three-dimensionality when inserted into a special box." .
