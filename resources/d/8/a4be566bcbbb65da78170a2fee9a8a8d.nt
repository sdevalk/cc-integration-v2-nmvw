It would appear, from the number and position of the horses and riders, that they had disciplined cavalry in those days. They have nothing of the kind in Cambodia at present, and they have no horses which, in height, bear the same proportion to their riders. The native horses of Cambodia are, like the ponies of Sumatra, small, not much over the size of our Shetland breed. We have here, therefore, some decided indications of a foreign, probably Tartar, element existing at an early period in Cambodia. This, however, in common with the indications we find in the general buildings of a knowledge of classical architecture, is left for the careful investigation of future and more erudite explorers. The bas-relief from which this is taken appears to represent an army returning from battle. The captives - men, women, and children - are guarded by cavalry in front and rear, and appear to be of different nations, as the costumes are totally different. A chief, for example, seated on an elephant, wears a helmet terminating in what appears to be the horns of a deer, similar to the helmets worn by Japanese archers, which form part of the King of Siam's body guard at the present time. A species of armour covers his shoulders, and falls from the back of the helmet to the waist. An ornamental belt round the waist supports a similar protection that covers the limbs. His followers on foot are similarly dressed; they are preceded by an advanced guard of cavalry, and appear to be prisoners of war.\r\nThe only resemblance we can trace between the horses of this and those of the Assyrian bas-reliefs, is in the cropped mane. (*) The harnessing of the head is different, and in the Cambodian example we have what looks like armour on the neck of the horse. The jacket of the rider, also, appears to be of a stiff material, probably intended to resist arrow points. The lower portion of the picture represents the beginning of the subject, where human torture is depicted in its most revolting forms. It is curious to find that the dress of the sufferers is identical (what is left of it) with that of those who are having the worst of it in battle (see battle scene, p.6), and that of their persecutors with the dress of the conquerors. We might infer from this that the contest was for the establishment of a new religion or kingdom, and that those who would not conceive it were tortured in the manner represented in the bas-relief.(!)\r\n\r\n(*) Layard's Nineveh, vol.
