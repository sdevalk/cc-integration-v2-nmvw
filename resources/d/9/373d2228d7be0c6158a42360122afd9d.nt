The heoritti is used as a general term of belt, but this heoritti means the practical one used to prevent men's wide trousers from slipping down. \r\n\r\nA belt used with trousers of Hanbok is usually 170-180 cm in length and 3-7 cm in width and made of the same material as the trousers. The way of tying the belt is as follows. First, fold the trousers to be lined toward the left side. Then tie the belt round your waist one time, then make its knot go to the right side and be shaped like a straight line. At last, roll the ends into knots and put them in the inside of belt so as to not to be conspicuous and finish with turning down a hem of the trousers, which is in above the belt." .
