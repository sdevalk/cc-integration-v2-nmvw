Een groot aantal vrouwen, weergegeven door U-vormen, verzamelde zich op deze plaats om ceremonies uit te voeren. De vrouwen, waarvan er een tot de Nangala skingroup en de anderen tot de Napaltjarri skingroup behoorden, reisden later naar het oosten. Een van de mythologische verhalen die bij het gebied horen, gaat over de affaire tussen een man van de Tjakamarra skingroup en een vrouw van de Nangala skingroup. Dit is een schoonmoeder-schoonzoon verhouding en uitgesproken taboe in de Aboriginal cultuur.\r\n\r\nThis painting depicts designs associated with the rockhole site of Umari, situated in sandhill country, east of Mt. Webb in Western Australia.\r\nA large number of women, represented by the Ú' shapes, gathered at the site to perform ceremonies.\r\nThe women, one of the Nangala kinship subsection and the others of the Napaltjarri kinship subsection, later traveled towards the east. \r\nOne of the mythologies associated with the area concerns a relationship between a man of the Tjakamarra kinship subsection and a woman of the Nangala kinship subsection. This is a mother-in-law relationship which is very taboo in Aboriginal culture.\r\n\r\nDESERT ART\r\n\r\nThe inland of Australia consists mainly of desert. For thousands of years the Aborigines have wandered in small family groups through these immense plains as hunters and food gatherers.\r\n\r\nGovernmental policy\r\nIn the fifties and sixties, groups of Aborigines were put together in governmental settlements. The stated intention·was: 'to keep the Aborigines under control, tor the sake of their development'. In these 'communities' the government provided some facilities like concrete houses and schools. Some health-care and employment was organised and welfare payments, since traditional food collecting was limited. Residents could only leave their community with the permission of white Australians. When settlements became overpopulated, people were transported with trucks to other settlements. This did not happen out of free will, but was forced. The result was that Aborigines sometimes walked back hundreds of kilometres, whereupon they were once more taken back by truck.\r\n\r\nThe Papunya settlement\r\nIn the seventies a few tribes were forced to live together in Papunya. In 1971 a white art teacher, Geoffrey Bardon, came to their school. He became interested in traditional painting through his contacts with older Aborigines. The school in which he taught was a concrete building that could use some colour. A mural painting was made by the Aborigines with the traditional designs. After several experiments they started to paint on canvas. Acrylic paint seemed an excellent choice in this dusty area because the paint dries quickly. From Papunya the art movement extended to the other settlements each community developing its own, distinctive style.\r\n\r\nThe paintings\r\nMost of the paintings consist of dots and circles. The men were the first to transfer to the acrylic-canvas medium. Their work is highly symbolic: representing ancestral history and nomadic routes. The paintings often look like maps, seen from the sky. Only a person with considerable knowledge of the depicted locations and the dreamings related to them can understand the symbols properly. A circle may represent a campsite, waterhole or fire. More and more women have started to paint in recent years. Their subjects often have to do with the search tor and the preparation of food. They are also inspired by ceremonial body-paint designs." .
