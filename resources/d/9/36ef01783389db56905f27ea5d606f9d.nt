Not only did they introduce metal tools to the people living at these places but they also influenced Aboriginal art forms, so that many Aboriginal paintings resemble the complicated designs seen on Indonesian batiks.\r\n\r\nIn this painting the artist has depicted five boats, each with four circles, which represent the \"eyes\" or headlamps seen on Macassan praus. Liwukan states that in a dream a relative of his saw a Mamu spirit boat with headlamps beaming as it approached the mainland from Elcho Island. In the boat was the spirit of his relatives' newborn baby son. The beams are shown as horizontal lines radiating from the front and back of the boat.\r\nTriangles on either side of the painting represent the traditional pattern of stormclouds.\r\n\r\nThe boat and the horizontal lines radiating out from each end also represent the shapes of squids. Circles are their eyes and the radiating horizontal lines are their long tentacles trailing in the water. In the Dreamtine two ancestral beings called the Djan'kawu visited Elcho Island, plunging their digging sticks into the ground to create waterholes, some of them sacred, and also distributed totemic emblems (rangga) to various clan groups. The Warrarnirri people were given Squid (lemin) as their main totem.\r\n\r\nMamu also transports the souls of the deceased from Elcho Island to a mystical island, where the newly deceased person is welcomed by the spirits of people who have long since left their earthly bodies and share a life of happiness, youth and good health forever on the Island of Spirits.\r\n\r\nBron: Aboriginal Fine Arts, Darwin NT" .
