Delcour: Sint-Antoniusbeeld in het Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde. 1999.\r\n\r\nZie metatekst M6-25\r\n\r\nTekst Weeks 1914:\r\nThis wooden image, still in my possession, was given me thirty years ago by a lad in whose family it had been for several generations, and by them it had been regarded as a fetish. It most probably belongs to the sixteenth century, when the R.C. priests were dominant in the country." .
