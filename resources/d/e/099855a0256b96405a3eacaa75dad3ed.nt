<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7223-2> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Traditionally, Santa Muerte, a Mexican Catholic saint with roots in both European Catholicism and Aztec religion, was considered the patron saint of marginalized people who led their lives ‘outside of’ mainstream society. These could be criminals, but also street vendors, sex workers and members of the LGBT community. Well into the 20th century, devotion to Santa Muerte was prohibited and actively repressed by the Catholic church. In the last decades, however, the cult of Santa Muerte has become more visible, not just in Mexican city streets, but also in global media and popular culture. Blockbuster series like Dexter and Breaking Bad have popularized the image and idea of Santa Muerte as saint of drug lords, hired guns and smugglers." .
