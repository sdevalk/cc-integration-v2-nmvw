<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/b4c3e08e4c6ff592cd726138cff0faca> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This is a poster dedicated to Vishnu, with the localised form of Sri Venkateswaran, the deity who resides in the Tirupati temple complex in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh (South India), featured prominently in the centre. Around Venkateswaran, the ten avatars of Vishnu are depicted:\r\n Right hand column (going down): Buddha, Narasimha,Vahara, Kurma, and Matysa,\r\nRight hand column (going down): Parashurama, Ram, Vamana, Krishna, and Kalki.  Across the bottom, to extra images, one of Vishu, and one of Vishu seated beside the goddess. \r\nVishnu's mythology details how he comes down to earth in these nine forms, and the tenth--Kalki--is yet to come. Some people have likened this to messianic structure of Judaism and forms of Christianity, but within living Hindu traditions the coming of Kalki has not generated specific forms of worship or communities who 'wait' for return. The concept of 'avatar' works differently, wherein there is a movement between worlds of the divine." .
