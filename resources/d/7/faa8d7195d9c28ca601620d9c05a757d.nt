<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/b1ba0f4deb9d3d23725237e701c572ec> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The ladle is made of half a coconut shell and a wooden ladle. The hollowed out and smoothed coconut is parted in half (not necessarily evenly). A carved wooden ladle of different size and adornment is glued to the coconut. It is always attached in the inside. The manufacture was the work of the men, as is almost all carving  and wood work. \r\nDifferent kinds of adornments can be identified. They most probable don't have a special meaning, but are expression of the artist's creativity. Animal or human figures are probably an allusion to ancestral beings and totems. The handle is glued to the coconut shell on the inside. A whole human figure is carved out of the wood in a naturalistic style. It wears a hat and probably represents a man. One can easily see the eyes, ear adornment, some chest adornment, arm rings and leg bands, because they are carved out and painted white. The ladle is coloured red. The knees are slightly bent. \r\n\r\nThe ladle was used to scoop liquids and solid food from pots and kettles, often from a big wooden bowl. This was often done on feasts, to give out soup to guests. The ladles were kept in the house of the men and were sometimes a present to guests." .
