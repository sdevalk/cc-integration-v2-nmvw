Ronde navel, groot geslachtsdeel en uitstaande benen op een rond doorhoord blok, waarop twee vertikale rijen tenen zijn aangegeven.\r\nHing aan een rotareep in een mannenhuis.\r\nZwaar door houtworn aangetast, ger. door Roefs 1950.\r\n\r\nHuman figures frequently formed the carved tops of the supporting posts rising through an opening in the floor of the ondoforo house (the home of the village chief). They often followed closely the original shape of a tree trunk, the arms and the lower limbs are only sketchily indicated. The size, the construction and the ornamentation of his house also reflected his power. Sentani houses were built on pilings out in the water. Rectangular in shape, they varied in length from about thirty to ninety feet. They had a ridge pole, and the sloping sides of the roof outlined the triangular walls at the front and the back. The walls along the sides, which were very low were hidden by the roof coming down to the ground. The central passage running from front to back had a number of rooms on each side. These rooms were created by screens made from the midribs of sago leaves, and between the rooms there were open spaces with large fireplaces. The ridge pole was supported by a number of heavy posts which were elaborately carved in the ondoforo house (see 3103-1)." .
