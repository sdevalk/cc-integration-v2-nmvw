Like the Leiden museum, this international event also focused on the Asia-Pacific region. On display were collections from India, Iran, China, Japan, the Pacific, and South Africa, sent in by museums, trading companies and private collectors from across Europe (Serrurier 1883a). During the exhibition several groups of Native people were presented to the visiting public, showcased in replicas of traditional villages. This included groups from the Dutch colonial East and West Indies, the latter including Indians from Surinam. For a short while a group of Omaha Indians who had previously been presented in a similar context at the Jardin d’Acclimitation in Paris stayed in the Dutch capital and was presented to the public. Such shows of “primitive peoples” were a common occurrence in the decades around 1900 (e.g. Hamy 1883; Coutancier 1992:33-47; Corbey 1993; Feest 1987; Montijn 1983:34-42).\r\n\r\nIt is not known who brokered the European visit of the Omahas. Their visit is documented in contemporary newspapers and Prince Roland Bonaparte, a scientifically educated nobleman, sponsored a portfolio of photographs of the group during their stay in France (Bonaparte 1883; Hamy 1883). Because of his good contacts with anthropologists and museum staff in The Netherlands, including Herman ten Kate and Leiden director Lindor Serrurier, it was probably Bonaparte who facilitated the visit of the Omaha delegation to Amsterdam. At both occasions the group was presented to a gazing public, as was a presentation of tribal artifacts. In Amsterdam Bonaparte sponsored a similar photographic portfolio of the native peoples of Surinam who were shown at the colonial exhibition. Later the French prince would conduct anthropological fieldwork among the Sami in northern Scandinavia, accompanied by his Dutch friend Herman ten Kate (Hamy 1883; Hovens 1989:145,180,197-198; Coutancier 1992:50-120; Maxwell 1999:44-49). After the fair in Amsterdam the buildings of the Indonesian villages were taken down, reconstructed near the ethnology museum building in Leiden, and manikins in traditional dress added, thus becoming one of the first “open air” museum presentations in Europe. In the 1890s a Dutch audience was offered the opportunity to gasp at Native Americans during the Wild West shows of Buffalo Bill (1891) and Pawnee Bill (1894) when these entourages visited The Netherlands on their European tours (Hovens, i.p.)." .
