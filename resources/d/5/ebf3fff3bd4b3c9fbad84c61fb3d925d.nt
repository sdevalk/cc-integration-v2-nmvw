It has a rectangularly shaped piece in the centre, which sticks out to help placing the stick on the shoulders. This stick has black and white paintings on the middle part as well as on the ends. The tips are round. The wood is coloured red, the carvings black and white. \r\nThe sticks were used by women of the mountain area to carry water containers made of coconuts. Bundles of these water containers were hung on both ends of the stick which was placed on the shoulder. \r\n\r\nThe sticks were probably exclusively used on Lou island." .
