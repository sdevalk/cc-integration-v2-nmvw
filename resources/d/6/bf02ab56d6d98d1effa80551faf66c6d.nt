The religious phrase “Alhamdulillahi rabbi l-alamina”, which means “Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds”, written in the shape of a tulip is a common phrase.\r\n\r\nSince the start of the Islamic era calligraphy has been a highly regarded art form owing to its close connection to the writing of the Quran. Over the centuries the art form has been applied on multiple media, and developed both as a decorative and an autonomous art form." .
