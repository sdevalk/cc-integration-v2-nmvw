The coconut is freed from the outer shell with the hair. Then it is smoothed with a knife and polished with a file. This was made by men. Embossed patterns are carved out of the surface. \r\nThe coconuts served as containers for water. This special container with the decorations was probably primarily used as a drinking vessel rather than a means of transportation." .
