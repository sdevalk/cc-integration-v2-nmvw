<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/TM-5242-1> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Arpilleras reflect a South American folk art that uses applique, embroidery and patchwork to depict scenes of everyday life. The Spanish word arpillera derives from an old Spanish word for burlap. They are sometimes called cuadros (squares). Most arpilleras are used as pictures and hung on walls. The most famous arpilleras and arpilleristas (the women who make them) are from Chile.\r\n\r\nArpilleristas make their arpilleras with scrap material, they embroider and sew it on burlap. They are cheap to make and do not require high technical skills, thus people from all social backgrounds can make arpilleras. The cloths are mostly embroidered in a communal setting, sharing one's story with the others not only through the cloth, but also verbally by narrating one's experience. \r\n\r\nThis arpillera does not have a denoucatory character like the other ones in the collection. It is not uncommon to find arpilleras with \"happy\" motives, as arpillerista would sometime depict joyful moments from their memories and hopes for a better future. It is a beautiful example of the pre-political traditional arpillera style. Unlike the political arpilleras, which grew from this folk tradition, this piece seems to depict a less anxious, and less complicated time.\r\n\r\nA similar arpillera can be found here: https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/conflicttextiles/search-quilts2/fulltextiles1/?id=75" .
