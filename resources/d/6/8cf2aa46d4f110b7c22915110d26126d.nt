<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7106-266> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This artwork is a barkpainting with natural ochres form Arnhem Land, Australia. The first barkpainting probably were made on the inside of rain shelters. Lengths of Eucalyptus bark were attached with their smooth insides to simple frames of branches. People then would decorate the bark during periods of forced idleness. 19th Century explores reported that bark paintings were an important factor in rituals and ceremonies. Today this is still the case in Arnhem Land. The choice and treatment of subjects was limited by cultural and religious traditions. Some of the paintings could only be exposed to initiated people. The wet season is the best time to harvest the bark because it is flexible then and easy to remove. The loose peace of bark is put on a steady fire face down. Because of the heat the bark flattens and the moisture evaporates. Weighed down with stones the bark is left for a few days.  Later, to keep the bark from warping sometimes sticks are attached to the top and bottom.\r\nArnhem Land artist rarely use colours other then the basic red, yellow, black and white. The red an yellow derive from the ochres that are found in the ochre pits. Black stems from charcoal and white is made from plaster or pipe clay. The material is finely ground, mixed with water and a binder to create paint.  The simple trow-away brushes are made of bark-fibres, human hair, chewed twigs and thin shoots.\r\nWithin Arnhem Land there are distinct regional styles. The famous x-ray style is mostly  found in the western part. Not only the outside of a human being, animal or spirit is painted, but also important organs and the spine. These paintings often have a plain background and one or two figures, one of them being a Mimi spirit. In northern and eastern Arnhem Land often the whole bark is covered with figures or abstract, geometric patterns. Frequently there is a border around the painting and the work is divided into segments representing different stories. In Central Arnhem Land there is more of an exchange between the different groups. Art here is open to change. The composition is more important than the intricate attention to details and thus acquires greater vitality." .
