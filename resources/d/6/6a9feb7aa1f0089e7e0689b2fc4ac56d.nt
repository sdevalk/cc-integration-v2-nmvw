It is likely a type of Kapok or a similar plant. The fibres are contained in an envelope from the Nederlandsch Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging (now Zuid-Afrikahuis, Amsterdam) addressed to C. Beelaerts van Blokland, the donor of this series. The envelope was likely reused by Blokland, and is not related to its contents.\r\n\r\nInside, alongside the fibres, is a printed proclamation of the government of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek encouraging its citizens to contribute to the Exposition Internationale d'Anvers, held in 1894. There is a small handwritten note indicating that the object is from Kleinfontein farm, and sent in D. Botha from Marico. A miss Dan. Botha from Marico is listed in the Catalogue Officielle of the exhibition as well as in the Z.A.R. Catalogue by P.C. Baerveldt as having contributed raw silk to the exhibition. Likely this plant matter was used as a silk substitute, or otherwise turned into textiles.\r\n\r\nThe Staatsalmanak der Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek voor het jaar 1894 lists a D.L. Botha from Klein Marico as the assistant Veldkornet, and a gold claim at a farm near Marico is assigned to J.D.L. Botha in the same year. J.D.L. Botha is also mentioned in the Almanak for the year 1899 as the District-Commandant. One D. Botha is also mentioned in the catalogue of the Z.A.R. section of the 1893 exhibition as contributing a spear taken during a war against Mzilikazi's Matabele. Likely the two Bothas are related as they are from the same place. Kleinfontein farm is likely the location some 6-7 kilometres west of Groot Marico where the Battle of Kleinfontein was fought in 1901 during the South African War." .
