<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/e26edb02605627058c0353073e7b4971> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Mimih spirit sculpture\r\nAboriginal people in the rocky environments of western Arnhem Land tell of the existence of tall slender spirits which they call mimih. The mimih are said to have taught humans the foundations of their culture, including ceremony, song, hunting skills and survival in the rocky escarpment country. Many very old examples of red rock art are attributed to the mimih.\r\nThe mimih are usually benign, shy spirits which flee at the approach of intruders in their rocky domain. They blow on the rocks to open them, and allow them to go inside to a dark world where they live with tame pythons and Black Wallaroos. Mimih are terribly thin, having necks so slender that a stiff breeze could be fatal. Therefore, they emerge only on windless days and at nights to hunt.\r\nSometimes the mimih are described as mischievous and dangerous to humans, kidnapping of killing them. Clever men sometimes befriend the mimih and are taught their songs and dances and shown their secret places. The mimih are like people using the same kinship terms and speaking the same language as the local Aboriginal group. They live in families like humans and it is said that some Aboriginal men with mystical knowledge have spent time loving with them in their camps.\r\nThe painting of mimih is not set by ancestral precedent and is very popular amongst Aboriginal artists in west Arnhem Land. By painting mimih they can create familiar, mundane scenes that relate to their own experiences in the world." .
