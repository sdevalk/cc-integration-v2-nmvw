The curvature is obtained by pulling out the upper tusk of boars, and thus enabling the lower tusks to grow freely in a circular shape. It may occur in a natural state if the positions of the tusks allow it. It could be used to make ornaments worn in nose, on the chest, or around the arms. They could also be fixed on bags." .
