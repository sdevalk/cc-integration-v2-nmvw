<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/19efdeaf98b4a091ba4e2bee58c4e240> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Shaky and unstable, a camera follows three different runners across three very different landscapes. This video piece was created for the Contemporary art commission, Beelden rondom Volkenkunde, for the redesign of the museum in 1999.  Moshekwa Langa’s work is consistently resolute in its experimental approach to Medium. For the commission Langa created a video piece in three parts, to be displayed in the entrance of the museum. Two men and one woman run in three separate screens on a continuous loop. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn his proposal Langa highlights how the most important element to him is the encountering process of the artwork. He wants the visitor to see the figure running and wonder the circumstances surrounding the event of running. He contrasts three people in three different settings all running, to where? From where? And why? These are the questions the viewer is faced with in frantic and fanatic encounter on endless loop. The work is meant to energize a viewer with question, as well as highlighting the shared activity of running which looks and feels urgent with movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note, his visual lexicon used in the piece for the Volkenkunde, is continued in his piece Martha, featured in the exhibition Fugitive, in 2017. He created a similar video piece to the one made for the commission in the NME Leiden. Instead of a tripartite series he made a diptych named Overseas I/Overseas II, 2017. This piece was filmed in his homespace of Bakenburg. His neighbor a woman presumably named Martha, runs through the dry, dusty landscape, as she is followed by the shaky, unstable camera. The practice of motion always apparent, the viewer desperately seeks a reprieve in camera work, something to focus on, a fixed place to establish orientation. Is this not what the dislocated person wants as well? The temporal gap between the each of the productions of videos is interesting to note. A span similar in time to the span of revisitation of the Leiden commission. Yet the works seem to be echoing the same sentiments, utilizing the same visual lexicon, and explicating the same themes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLanga talks about the problems when encountering the museum, “I noticed that although the museum had artifacts from every corner of the world, there was nothing from Holland-nothing focusing on their own cultural heritage…it related to the idea of people not studying their own artifacts: they claim expertise on all these other cultures on the outside but we don’t know anything about them.”" .
