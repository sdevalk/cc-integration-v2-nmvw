It features the faces of King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima as well as the Dutch flag. Also depicted on the cloth are the roller-printers used to make this type of textile.\r\n\r\nVlisco (previously P. Fentener van Vlissingen & co.) was founded in Helmond in 1846. It primarily manufactured imitation batiks for the Indonesian market – though nowadays there is little resemblance between Vlisco batiks and authentic batiks. Vlisco batiks were marketed towards poorer customers in Indonesia but won little market share and imitation batiks were later banned. Customers who could afford batiks authentic preferred Javanese batiks over Vlisco products. \r\nAs Vlisco could not establish itself in Indonesia the company began to establish itself in African markets instead. Here the firm had great success: Based on their experience in Indonesia – where customers only purchased textiles that met their specific requirements – Vlisco researched the tastes of African customers to determine which kinds of textiles would be popular.\r\n\r\nVlisco products included wax print textiles for everyday use as well as commemorative cloths such as this one. The specific innovations in wax printing meant that this kind of cloth is only made by Vlisco. This kind of cloth spread throughout West- and Central Africa and this style remains popular today. Historically Vlisco cloth was made exclusively for the export market and not sold in the Netherlands. However, this piece was made for the Dutch public.\r\nCommemorative cloths often depict political events such as the inauguration of African presidents, a visit by American president Obama, or in this case, the inauguration of Willem-Alexander as King of the Netherlands." .
