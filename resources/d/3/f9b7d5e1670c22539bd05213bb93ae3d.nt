<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-2385-8> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This dance ornament represents a white heron (yowi). It has a wooden head with a long nozzle and eyes indicated by abrus pips. The long wooden neck is on the top partly decorated with red feathers. The body is made from wood and sago-leaf stem tightened together with rattan to imitate bird feathers. There are also a few real feathers attached to the body, mainly on the sides. There is a hole in middle of the figure through which goes a long flexible stick (arib). Its upper part is bent and the bird's head is attached with a rope. The lower part goes through a wooden platform (humum) decorated with feathers, on which the bird rests, and which is attached to the bearer's head. Sometimes the head with the neck of the figure come from a real bird (Baal, J. van, 1938. Archive RMV, Leiden, RMV series 2385).\r\n\"Perched on the top of his head, each [humum-ornament bearer] wears an animal figure, fastened by means of a long rod which passes right through the hairdo and the body of the animal and ends in a long plume. Slipped round the rod, below the plume, is a singsingi, a rattle consisting of a piece of bamboo filled with the hard kernels of some fruit. The animal figure is set off against a kind of nimbus, a construction of ribs of palm-leaflets dotted with down. The nimbus is called humum, literally cloud, clouded sky, and this name came to be applied to the whole show\" (Van Baal, 1966:855-856), humum-angai (TM-number: 5969-25). It is \"a show of richly decorated men combined with a dema-wir [Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 9] of some sort\" (ibid.: 829). \r\n\r\nVan Baal gives a description of one such ceremony: \"Now a long procession of fantastically decorated men and children approaches from the east. They were light, softwood images of birds, fishes and other animals, swinging to and fro at the end of the long elastic rods which rise above the humum, the elaborate, delicate structure of fragile laths lined with down and plumes which crowns their heads like a nimbus. Darkness has fallen now and the women surrounding them carry flaming torches. When they have arrived near the festive grounds, all kneel down, the iwag comes forward again and, beating the ground with croton-twigs, permits them to rise and enter the enclosure, where the dance goes on till daybreak\"(ibid.: 852).\r\nThe ceremonial dance ornament is the Wokabu-rek clan emblem representing a totemic ancestor/animal, a white heron, whose ritual significance and cultural symbolism are rooted in Marind mythology.  \t\t\t\t                                                                                    According to van Baal, yowi is one of the Mahu-ze phratry's totems because it plays a role in a few Mahu-ze myths (ibid.: 309-312). One of them narrates about a Diwa-canoe (which bears a name of dema Yugil). Yowi sat at the front place of this boat and together with other dema sailed from Yavar-makan (the mayo area) to Senayo to partake on a big feast celebrating the marriage between Harau and Elme. During their return from the feast a big sea-snake, \"Salendo approached the canoe and stirred up a strong eddy. The canoe, which slowly followed Salendo down the river, had to be relieved of its load and successively a sago-powder, an old woman (who changed into a tortoise), a couple of fishes (hara and karambu, the later a member of the puntius family) and a big load of sago were thrown out. â€¦ Then, at Sirapu, a little distance upstream from Merauke, on the opposite bank, Salendo reappeared and assailed the canoe, which turned upside down\" (ibid.: 312). The dema were left at Sirapu where they live till today. Salendo swam to Anassai where he has remained in a swamp, called Mayo, up to the present day.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to the myth of Wokabu, the sago dema (Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 32, Fig. 1 and Wirz, P., 1928, p. 16, Fig. 2.), yowi has been placed by Wokabu right at the top of a high sago-palm, dah (Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 54, Fig. 20) (ibid.: 337).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    A head ornament representing a white heron is also used as a decoration of the dancers during the imo cult initiation rites celebrating the imo-canoe. Dema \"emerge from the dema-houses, each carrying the replica of a canoe on his head. Though the bodies of the performers are completely plastered with white clay, this is hardly visible, because they go decorated with a profusion of plumes of birds of paradise, white herons and cassowaries\"(ibid.: 618).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t         \r\nMany ritual objects (like weapons, bullroarers or drums) are addressed by certain formulas. The heron-beak (darau-angib) is a kind of arrow, which is addressed by this spell: \"Darau-angib! Hot-tempered one! Bite into blood\" (ibid.: 872).\r\nThe Marind medicine-man has to eat the fat of a bird, which is a good flyer. Later, after a period of fasting he goes to a bush hut, where he decorates his arms with the flight-feathers of the yowi bird (ibid.: 899). Thus the heron is associated with Marind shamanism.\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 20.11. 2006" .
