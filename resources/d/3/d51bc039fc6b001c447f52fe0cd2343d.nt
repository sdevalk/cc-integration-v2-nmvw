De bovenzijde van de klomp is bestreken met een zwarte verf en daarna ingesneden met cursieve grassprietpatronen aan de zijkanten en met parallelle lijnen aan de voorzijde.\r\n\r\nThis kind of shoe, made of hollowed-out wood and with a heel, was designed for rainy days.  A namakshin without a heel was called a \"flat namakshin.\" With many names according to the region, a namakshin could be made   of various wood, but those made of paulownia or willow were considered the best. Sometimes waxed to prevent cracking, these shoes were worn by young and old, men and women, regardless of social status. They were often worn even on sunny days, but due to their weight and bulkiness, they were not worn for a long journey or for horseback riding. \r\n\r\nThe encyclopedic book \"Random Expatiations\" (\"Oju yeonmun jangjeon sango\") by Yi Kyu-gyong (1788-?) records that lowborn or young people were not allowed to wear these shoes around an aristocrat or an old   man, because the sound they made on a dry road sounded \"presumptuous\" to their ears. At the end of the Choson dynasty (1drie92-1910), the namakshin was a symbol of honest poverty among fallen literati." .
