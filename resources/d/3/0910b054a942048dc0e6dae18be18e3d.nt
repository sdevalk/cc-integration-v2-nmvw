The jar’s shoulder includes two balanced designs that are similar but not mirror copies of one another. The designs appear to be that of birds – the distinctive three-feathered tail ending in a curled-up head. Others might suggest that the design is a katsina, a convincing interpretation given what appears to be a face just above the tail feathers. The inventiveness of the design suggests that Nampeyo may have made this jar. \r\nNampeyo began using prehistoric designs on her pottery somewhere between 1885 and 1890. The inspiration for Nampeyo was the nearby ancestral village of Sityatki that was abandoned about 1600. By 1900, Nampeyo stopped using a white slip to cover the yellow clay that characterizes the Polacca Polychrome style, the type of pottery she learned as a child and practiced as a young adult. The slip had a different shrinkage than the base clay resulting in a crackled slip. Eventually, Nampeyo abandoned using slip. She also determined that by polishing a pot’s surface it added brilliance to the finished pot and probably helped in reducing crackling on the fired pot’s surface due to the lower firing temperature. No doubt there was experimentation and discovery as she learned to build pots with the step shoulders and investigated new design iconography and design orientation and placement.\r\nNampeyo’s two non-Native advocates were trader Thomas V. Keams and ethnologist Alexander Stephens, both of whom lived at Hopi and knew potters personally and purchased hundreds of pieces from them as well. In the 1890 census there were 365 women whose occupation was listed as “potter,” but remarkably only one of these women is known by name. In an era when pottery principally was collected by scientists for museums and study, Keam marketed Nampeyo as a person of extraordinary ability and singular accomplishment.\r\n\r\nNampeyo’s artistry parallels and is integral in the creation of the commercial Indian art market that still functions today. The Hopi pottery revival was the first marketing success for Pueblo art pottery; a pottery made exclusively to sell to outsiders in return for money. By 1900 Hopi wares were sold throughout the Fred Harvey chain of restaurants and hotels. Literally tens of thousands of Hopi pots were sold between 1910 and 1930 (Allen 1984:22-23). There were numerous other Native artists making pottery, baskets and textiles for the non-Indian market by 1900 but no other person’s work was sold by name. Tribal names were generally the entirety of their published identity.  In addition, at the turn of the 20th century, “Indian” was often pejorative and synonymous with simplistic, a culturally backward but perhaps endearing society. The unfortunate and derogatory term “squaw” was used to describe Native women, a remarkable underestimation and appreciation of any Native person let alone the superbly talented and artistically ascendant Nampeyo.\r\n\r\nOther potters were compared to Hopi potters, Maria Martinez being characterized as \"good as the best of the Hopi potters\" (El Palacio 1919:98). San Ildefonso potters Tonita Roybal used Hopi designs and Julian Martinez looked first to Hopi revival pottery for designs for his wife's pottery until Chapman suggested he look at more local ancestral designs.\r\n\r\nThe degeneration of Hopi ceramics in the 17th century and the arrival of Nampeyo’s immediate ancestors at Hopi are both attributable to Spanish colonization in the American Southwest. Along with the establishment of Spanish mission at Hopi in 1629, sheep were also introduced. The Hopis soon abandoned the traditional use of coal as a firing fuel source and started using sheep dung. The sheep dung fuelled fires only reach about 950 degrees Fahrenheit as compared to the nearly 2000 Fahrenheit temperature of coal firing. As a result, Hopi pottery became thicker and heavier than it had been in previous times. In addition, the Spanish influenced forms such as plates and cups. The Pueblo Revolt in 1680 removed the oppressive colonists from the Southwest during which the Hopi destroyed the church at their village of Awatovi. The Spanish would not try and colonize at Hopi again.\r\n\r\nSpanish resettlement and reconquest of the Southwest began in 1692 and was swift and harsh. Some groups of Tewa fled Spanish retribution and rule; arriving at Hopi in about 1696. Refugees were permitted to settle on Third Mesa in exchange for serving as a defensive perimeter to the Spanish and increasing raids from Navajo and Apache people. These refugees included Nampeyo’s direct ancestors.\r\n\r\nBruce Bernstein; Coe Foundation for the Arts\r\nSanta Fe, NM\r\n\r\nLaura Graves Allen, Contemporary Hopi Pottery; Museum of Northern Arizona; Flagstaff, 1984.\r\n\r\nAardewerk in Sikyatki Revival stijl, beschilderd met vruchtbaarheidssymbolen. Deze naam is afgeleid van het laat-prehistorisch aardewerk Sikyatki Polychrome (1375-1625) wat door de voorouders van de Hopi werd gemaakt. Tijdens het laatste decennium van de 19e eeuw lieten Hopi en Hopi-Tewa vrouwen van First Mesa zich inspireren door de vormen en decoraties van dit oude aardewerk. Dat werd mede verorzaakt doordat handelaar Thomas Keam daarvoor een markt zag en de archeoloog Jesse Walter Fewkes de nederzetting Sikyatki blootlegde en er veel aardewerk aan het licht kwam dat de pottenbaksters zagen. Nampeyo (Hopi-Tewa) nam daarin de leiding maar werd spoedig gevolgd door andere vrouwen toen het ceramiek goed werd verkocht. Zij was echter de meest kundige en demonstreerde haar vaardigheden aan bezoekers van de Grand Canyon en tijdens grote beurzen in de grote steden.\r\n\r\nSikyatki Revival stijl aardewerk is overwegend polychroom, rood of geel-wit. De decoratie bestaat overwegend uit figuren met ronde en golvende lijnen, passend bij de smaak uit de Art Nouveau periode. Veel voorkomende figuren zijn veren, regenwolken en kachinas, alle geassocieerd met vruchtbaarheid. Een innovatie was de vaas-vorm, vaak als tulpenvaas aangeduid.\r\n\r\nVanaf 1920 ging de kwaliteit van het Hopi-aardewerk snel achteruit door de nadruk op massaproductie. De School of American Research (Santa Fe) en het Museum of Northern Arizona (Flagstaff) hebben een belangrijke rol gespeeld in het op een nieuw kwalitatief niveau brengen van het Hopi aardewerk door hun aankoopbeleid, het uitgeven van een kwaliteitskeurmerk en het organiseren van gepremieerde wedstrijden voor pottenbaksters." .
