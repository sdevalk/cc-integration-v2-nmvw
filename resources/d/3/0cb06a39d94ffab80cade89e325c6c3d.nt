A number of plant threads or fibres were stretched parallel to each other on a wooden board. The number of threads coincided with the desired number of beads in each row. Another long thread was used to make the cross connection. Both threads were pulled through the bead. In this warp-plaiting technique, a whole cloth with different patterns would be made. This one has a frame with a cross in the middle which makes it look similar to the Union Jack. White, black, blue, yellow and red glass beads were used. On two sides, there are three pairs of plaited cord each, which were used to tie the cuff to the leg. Red and blue cotton strips are attached to the ends of these cords.\r\nThe leg bands were worn above the ankle and knotted in the front. Both women and men would wear these in combination with other adornment like plaited arm- and leg bands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2802-122a en 2802-122b op één kaart ; een stel" .
