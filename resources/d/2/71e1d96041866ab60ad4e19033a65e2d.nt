<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/AM-515-10> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Sansas, also known as thumb pianos, are musical instruments classified as lamellophones. They are constructed by attaching metal tines to a wooden board. Sansas are played using the thumbs and other fingers.\r\n\r\nThis particular sansa is constructed out of 17 metal tines attached to a wooden board. Of particular interest is the apparent use of recycled material in the form of the iron plate which is attached to the wooden board with wire. Although this sansa is attributed as being from Zambia, the inscription on the iron plate reads 'Embalada em Lourenco Marques' or 'Packaged in Louren√ßo Marques' which is Maputo in the present day Mozambique. \r\n\r\nWhile it is possible that the object was made in Mozambique, it appears that the metal plate was once part of some sort of metal container used for transport. It is possible then that this container was shipped to Zambia, and then recycled with the iron plate incorporated into the sansa. The use of recycled materials such as metal or telephone wire in objects such as musical instruments, ceremonial weapons, decorative objects, and tourist art, has been common in the Southern Africa region since at least the 19th century." .
