This kind of dagger seems to be characteristic for the Admiralty Islands. A whole ray-spine, which naturally has long rows of barbs on each side, is put into a wooden shaft. The joint is coated with a layer of Parinarium putty and additionally wrapped around with plant cords. The cords are painted with black and white rhomboid patterns on a red background. Underneath the joint there is a little human figure without arms, but big earlobes and big stylised feet. \r\nAs the handle is so slender and small in diameter, this dagger was most likely not used as a weapon itself, but tied to a much longer shaft to be used as spear. These spears were lighter in comparison to the obsidian-tipped spears and therefore mostly used as a javelin to throw from the distance. No spears were used for hunting, but as weapons in wars and fights. \r\nWarfare was one of the two areas in which the continuing vitality and power of a leading family or leading man were demonstrated. It was therefore crucial for maintaining the social hierarchy and can be seen as having been a normal aspect of life on the Admiralty Islands. The intensity and frequency of raids and fights probably increased after the arrival of Westerners, because they sold iron and weapons to the islanders which were firstly more effective and secondly produced an imbalance of power between the different clans. \r\nAmbushes or raids at dawn were frequent. The actual reasons or causes for attacks are not known, except that a leader would prove his strength and ability. The warriors were mostly young, unmarried adult men which were lead by a clan or group leader. They carried spears, javelins and daggers. All people in the attacked villages were killed, the eyes were gouged out with the sharp obsidian blades and sometimes the heads were cut off to be taken home as a trophy. Houses were burnt down. Fights were also decided on boats on the water." .
