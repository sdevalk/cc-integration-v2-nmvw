De Chosŏn T'ongbo was de eerste munt die tijdens deze periode werd gemaakt en kwam in omloop vanaf de jaren 1420. De vorm was afgeleid van munten uit Tang China (zevende-tiende eeuw).\r\n\r\nIn order to overcome disorder in the monetary system of the Koryŏ period, the Chosŏn Court established a centralized authority by systematizing politics, the economy, social and cultural matters and so on. The Chosŏn t’ongbo was the first coin made during this period and was manufactured from the 1420s. It was modeled after coins of Tang China from the seventh to the tenth century.\r\nThis is the first copper coin of the Chosŏn Dynasty. Chosŏn t'ongbo was manufactured in September 1424. Copper of 600g was priced at 150-mun of coins, and circulated in February 1425. However, economic exchange with money wasn't popularized because barter was still preferred in Chosŏn. After the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592, the necessity of coins was on the rise. As a result, chosontongbo was manufactured again in 1633, for the purpose of raising people incomes. This coin did not become popular currency as well.  Cotton fabrics, a cloth currency, were used nationwide, and rice and beans were also used in small transactions. \r\n\r\nIts form is a round shape with a square hole in its center and the term Chosŏn t'ongbo was inscribed on its front side in the square style. The handwriting inscribed varies in shape." .
