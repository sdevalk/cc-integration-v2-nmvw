Hindu divinity is often visualised through iconic (forms of goddesses and gods that we can recognize as having human-like attributes) or aniconic (abstract) forms. \r\nThe lingam is a representation of Shiva's divine energy and can be worshipped by offering flowers, or 'washing' the lingam with water and/or milk." .
