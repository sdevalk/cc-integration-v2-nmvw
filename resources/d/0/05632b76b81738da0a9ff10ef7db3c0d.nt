The animal has been painted in the socalled X-ray style, with some of the interal details shown. The heart is shown, with a lung on either side, and the backbone and ribs are seen.\r\n\r\nThis piece was painted for Lance Bennett during one of his visits to the small Aboriginal community on Mudginberri cattle station, between the South and East Alligator Rivers, in the Dry season of 1966.\r\n\r\ncopyright Lance Bennett\r\n\r\nSpender describes this X-ray-style figure in glowing words. The backbone is clearly visible. The backbone is regarded as the main, strong support of the body.\r\nThe most striking feature, however, to anyone acquainted with the kangaroo in its natural state is the really wonderful way in which the ... artist has depicted the pose that is always assumed by the animal when alarmed-the erect position of the body, the head thrown well up and slightly back, and the two little fore limbs held forwards helplessly. '(Spencer, 1928: 809-10.)\r\nSignificant, too, is the relative size of the hunter. His small figure is painted in the same way as the kangaroo: he is shown running, having just released from his thrower a spear which is about to enter its victim.\r\n\r\nBron: edited by Ronald M. Berndt, The Macmillan Compagny, New York Collier-Macmillan Ltd, Londen, 1964, p. 80." .
