This version likely dated to 1685. It is a composite of earlier maps including maps by Blaeu (1617), Hondius (1623), and Visscher (1658). The map represents a 17th century Dutch view of Africa and should not be thought of as an accurate or neutral depiction of the continent. \r\n\r\nMaps like these helped to both communicate and establish European stereotypes of the African continent and the people who lived there. The numerous images of European ships in the oceans surrounding Africa emphasize that Europe’s primary interest in Africa at this time was for trade and a route to Asia. At this time Europeans had not yet begun to colonize Africa on a large scale, though many European trading posts dotted the coastline. Various Dutch trading posts such as Elmina (‘S. George del Mina’) in West-Africa are indicated on the map. The Dutch outpost at the Cape of Good Hope (‘Cabo de bona Zperanza’) in South Africa is not depicted - possibly due to De Wit’s use of older maps. There are also mistakes from earlier maps such as the fictional island of Neustra I. de Saint Helena (not to be confused with St. Helena which is also depicted on the map).\r\n\r\nAt the time, Europeans had little knowledge of the interior of Africa. The interior of Africa depicted on this map contains a great deal of fictional elements. Following the map conventions common at the time, Africa is neatly divided into regions and numerous kingdoms and other realms are listed. Maps from this time often depict the political organization of Africa as similar to Europe. The maps depicting Africa as an empty continent would only emerge by the late 18th century during the prelude to colonization.\r\n\r\nInformation about the interior of Africa was derived from scattered and often unreliable sources ranging from the works of Claudius Ptolemy (ca. 100-170 C.E.) and information provided by early missionaries and sailors. The influence of Ptolemy can be seen in the lakes Zaire, Zembra, and Zafflan depicted in central Africa which ancient scholars believed to be the source of the Nile. Decorative drawings of animals such as elephants, lions, and ostriches, emphasize the exotic nature of the African continent as seen by a European audience.\r\n\r\nOn the bottom left there is a cartouche providing the name of the maker, given here in Latin as ‘Frederico de Wit’, and the place of publication Amsterdam. The cartouche is surrounded by exotic imagery. The people depicted represent stereotypical views of the various peoples inhabiting Africa. These groups may be identified by their clothes. Only the left side of the cartouche are North Africans, probably Moroccans. On the right side the depictions are likely of Congolese or Mozambican people." .
