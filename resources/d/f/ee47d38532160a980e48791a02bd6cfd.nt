<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/3e979cd4169d4c8bd5aed860bf02bca1> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This ceremonial dance ornament representing iguana (kadivuk) is an important part of a dema-performer outfit. It is carved from a single piece of wood except the four legs. It has been heavily corroded by worms. Painted in dark with white, yellow and brown spots the figure has a realistic appearance. The mouth, tail and legs are decorated with white feathers. The bottom has been hollowed out to fit the performer's head. On each side there are two round holes through which two long fibre cords go. By means of them the kadivuk could be tightened to the bearer's head. In the middle of the body there are also two holes to put a stick through. This suggests a second possibility of carrying this huge ornament - on the sticks above the performer's head. \r\n\r\nThe kadivuk figure was obtained by Father J. Verschueren during a ritual celebration in Wajaw (Kumbe-river) in November 1957. It is a good replica of a traditional ceremonial object made by people of Saror but used in the performance, sapra, on the occasion of a cult celebration in Wajau. During the ritual re-enactment of the Aramemb myth, the dema-performer carried kadivuk on his head. According to the myth, iguana is a hiding shape of dema Aramemb from which he can spy on his son who wants to steel a coconut; mythologically, coconut is Aramemb's property (Verschueren, 26-11-1957. Archive RMV, Leiden, series 3532).  \r\n\r\nThe iguana ornament represents a clan totem with correspondence to the bearer's clan affiliation. It is the totem of both the Kai-ze and Ndik-end clan. It is even possible to say that it is a totem of the Aramemb phratry as a whole (Van Baal. 1966: 307). Its ritual significance and cultural symbolism is rooted in the Marind mythology. In the myths kadivuk is sometimes referred to as to the midget crocodile because of its resemblance with a crocodile. The iguana image can be also represented on the taboo-signs.\r\n\r\nOne episode of Marind mythology narrates the adventure of dema Mahu (Mohue), who dwells in the village Waan (Muting area) near a big water well which is there till these days. The local people made it difficult for Mahu and did not invite him to one of their big ritual celebrations. To revenge himself he would dress up in his best clothes with all his dema attributes and decorations and in the evening he would come in his complete dema decoration to the celebration. Then all of a sudden he threw his iguana to the people. Many of the villagers were hit and died. After this, Mahu returned calmly to his village, where he disappeared forever in the well, which bears his name till today.\r\n \r\nOne of the female characters in Marind mythology is the iguana dema Upikak, who holds the island Habe (a small island near Birok) between her jaws. Wirz (1922-25, II: 102) suggests that \"she must be identified with the bank on the north side of the island. The bank is the iguana's body, its jaws the steep rocks rising from the sea\" (Van Baal, 1966: 275). According to another myth Upikak was a girl living on the Habe Island who has changed into an iguana. Later she married Aramemb (yam dema) and bore him the wallaby dema, Samanimb (ibid.: 276).\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 28.11. 2006" .
