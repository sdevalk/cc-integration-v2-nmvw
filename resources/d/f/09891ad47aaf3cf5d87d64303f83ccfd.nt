<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/799901b6aa34ae61d3cb32c425ce76d2> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Pair of panel doors, tropical hardwood, with inset ivory panels forming a geometric pattern of radiating ten-pointed stars. The ivory panel components are stars, kites and polygons, each carved with an outlined curvilinear design of foliate scrollwork and some strapwork, now slightly worn. The wooden doors are nineteenth-century replicas, while the ivory panels are fourteenth-century Mamluk objects from Cairo.\r\n\r\nThese panels were made in Cairo, Egypt. They are 19th century replicas of 14th century Mamluk minbar panels. During the Mamluk period (1250-1517) the minbar (or Islamic pulpit) was decorated with intricately carved ivory inlay. The pair of doors belonged to the collection of Count Gaston Saint Maurice, who was a prolific collector of Islamic objects. He was based in Cairo and it is likely that these doors were used to decorate the interior of his home, which was built in the neo-Mamluk style made popular in Cairo during the 1860s and 1870s. These reproduction panels would have been used to furnish the interior of the Count’s home.\r\n\r\nThis object was owned by Count Charles Gaston Esmangard de Bournonville de Saint Maurice (1831-1905). The Count lived in Cairo between 1868 and 1883 where he worked as the Grand Equerry for the Khedive. He was a major collector of Islamic Art in Cairo and it is likely that he would have commissioned the design of this panel. This panel would have been used to furnish his home in Cairo. The Count’s home in Cairo was designed by the French architects Ambroise Baudry and built in 1872 in the Neo-Mamluk style. The Neo-Mamluk style was formed from Mamluk architectural motifs such as brown and white striped facades, monumental entranceways and reclaimed mashrabiya windows (turned wood projecting windows). Gaston Saint Maurice’s home was a key example of this style. It was located in the newly developed city centre of Ismailiya based on the east bank of the Nile. \r\n\r\nIn 1878 the Count ran into financial difficulties and put both his Cairo home and its contents up for sale. This panel formed part of what would be later known as the Saint Maurice collection – which was comprised of Middle Eastern objects such as bronze and ivory doors, Persian and Egyptian tiles, mashrabiya windows, wooden inscriptions, clothes and jewellery and a collection of plaster casts. This collection was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1878. After being placed on display at the 1878 Exposition Universelle, the collection of 200 objects was then lent to the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris, from where the South Kensington Museum (V&A) made a large number of purchases to enhance their growing collection of Islamic art. The Musee des Arts Decoratifs also purchased nineteen inlaid panels. Together with the Meymar collection (accessioned in 1867), the Saint Maurice collection expanded the collection of ‘Saracenic’ art – or the art of the Mamluks (who ruled Egypt and Syria 1250-1517) – in this museum." .
