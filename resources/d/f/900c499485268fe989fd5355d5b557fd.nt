There is a small rectangular bag which has a bead netting around it. Fringes adorn the bottom. The bag has several plaited fibre straps to hang it around the neck and wear it on the chest.\r\n\r\nSpecial stones were kept in such a purse to protect the self from illness or bad spirits which can bring illness. Unfortunately, there is not more information about these stones in the literature." .
