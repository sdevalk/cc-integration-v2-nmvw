Black willow (Salix nigra) and sumac (Rhus) were also used to a certain extent. Seed beaters were not made in a twining but a wicker technique. Ten Kate recorded the native name of this artifact as áhvayjay, meaning \"beater\", but the full name was recorded by Robert McKennan of Kroeber's research team as sele' a'via (seed beater). The Walapais harvested a variety of wild seeds. These were gathered by beating the grasses and stems of plants with the beaters and catching the seeds and kernels in conical seed baskets or sometimes in basketry bowls. The major seed plant was called sele' and ripened in June-July. It was first boiled and roasted, or immediately roasted with charcoal on a basketry parching tray, ground into flour and baked into chunks or boiled in a mush. After drying and parching the seeds could also be stored for later use (Mason 1904:518; Kroeber et.al. 1935:48,55,79-81; Ewing 1960:68-69; Whiteford 1988:101-104; Bernstein et. al. 2003:73; Herold 2005:80-81).\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)\r\n\r\n\r\ninstrument gebruikt bij het inzamelen van graszaden enz., lepelvormig, gevlochten van boomtakjes; \"ávejé\" ser. etiket." .
