This movement was in favour of a separate, independent homeland for the Tamil population of Sri Lanka. \r\nRajiv Gandhi was the son of Indira Gandhi, India's first female prime minister, and the grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister. The Nehru/Gandhi family is associated with the Indian National Congress political party." .
