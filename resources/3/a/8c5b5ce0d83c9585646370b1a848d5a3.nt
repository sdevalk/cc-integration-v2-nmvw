It was carved from a separate piece of wood and then fixed to the mast with rattan cords. The halyard passed over the angle of the fork when the sails were hoist up. \r\nThe object is coloured with red, white and black. The two forks are beautifully decorated with human heads and crocodiles, which lay beneath the heads on the outer side. There are triangle patterns on the front and back." .
