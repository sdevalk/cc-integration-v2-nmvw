Woo Jinâ€™s ongoing series, Dokkaebi, are creatures from Korean mythology and folklore, which are told to have formed from a spiritual possession of an inanimate object. Through the creation of her own modern-day Dokkaebi, Woo Jin uses this being as a vessel and mischievous spokesperson for her imagined new world. Dokkaebi suggests an alternative way of moving through the material world that eschews our current capitalist obsession with disposability for a more mystical and enchanting frame of view.\r\n\r\nTales of Mountains and Seas is the result of an Artistic Research Residence at fashion platform New Order of Fashion. Supported by Creative Industries Fund NL." .
