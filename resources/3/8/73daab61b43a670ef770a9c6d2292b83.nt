It was played by two boys or men, one of whom threw the hoop (kep-a-choor), after which both threw their six feet long game poles along the ground to hit it. Depending on the position of the ring to the pole, one or two points were scored. Penetration of the ring did not count. A score entitled the player to the next throw of the ring. The number of points required for a win was agreed before each game (Forde 1931:132; Densmore 1932:194-195; Spier 1933:336; 1936:18; Trippel 1984:175; cf. Culin 1907:526).\r\n\tThe foundation of the two hoops consists of a bundle of cloth, which in one case is tightly wrapped with a thick cord, probably of native cotton, in the other case wrapped in several pieces of colored cloth, in both cases sturdily sewn.  \r\n(Hovens 2008-09)" .
