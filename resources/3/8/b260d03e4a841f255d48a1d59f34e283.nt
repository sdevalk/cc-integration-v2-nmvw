<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/45c286909805f6ef8a10a503721e1e0e> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Western Apache horseshoes; rawhide; l. 15.5 cm., w. 12 cm.; ca. 1880.\r\n\tTen Kate recorded: \"To protect the hooves of horses as much as possible from the rocky ground and the spines of the plants, the Apaches use coverings of thick, untanned leather with the hairy side facing outward, which are wrapped around when wet and, once dry, fit tightly around the hoof.\" Opler's (1941:396) Chiricahua informants said such shoes were always of cowhide, but generally whatever was available was used (Clark 1963:246-248). Although the shrinking of the rawhide is important, the shoes that Ten Kate collected, and all others known, also feature laces passed through slits in the edge of the shoes to help keep them on; such shoes might have holes cut in the bottom to let gravel out, and smaller shoes of this type were also made for burros (Baldwin 1965:87; Ferg 1987:81). The specimens Ten Kate collected in June/July 1883 at San Carlos, Arizona, look well-used.\r\nWhile, in pre-reservation days, lost horses could be replaced by stealing more, horses were certainly considered valuable, and all Apache groups cared for their horses, making a variety of horsegear, usually modeled on Spanish and Mexican equipment. Considerable effort could be lavished on saddles, wooden spurs, quirts, ropes, rawhide horseshoes, tack and saddlebags, and Ten Kate collected several of such artifacts: four saddlebags from different groups, rawhide horseshoes or boots at San Carlos, Mescalero stirrups, and a rawhide rope and two quirts (horse whips) which may be either Apache or Navajo, but are listed as Apache in the Leiden inventory, based on Ten Kate's notes. All of these articles, as well as simple rawhide hobbles, were undoubtedly made on similar patterns by several Southwestern groups, and it is often impossible to know if examples obtained from a group were made by them, or obtained in trade from another. The horseshoes are of a simple style known to have been made by several Apache groups, Navajos, and various Puebloan tribes, all of whom almost certainly were copying those used by early Spanish explorers (Clark 1963:246). The stirrups and rawhide rope are both known to have been made by various Southwestern groups, and Ten Kate (2004:206,244) specifically mentions stirrups for both the Apaches and Navajos. And again, the braided leather, and braided horsehair, quirts are known to have been made by various groups, but their specific origin is uncertain. The importance of the two specimens collected by Ten Kate, regardless of which group made them, is that they document that both techniques were fully known and in use in 1883; braiding of horsehair hatbands and curios among Western Apaches may be a later introduction (Ferg 1987:99,102).\r\nTen Kate scorned romantic novelists' notions of the Apaches possessing splendid horses, and was unimpressed by the animals he observed at San Carlos. They were of small but robust stature, bred for physical endurance, and appeared poorly cared for. Riders seemed to have little regard for their mounts and often rode them to death on raiding expeditions when spare animals were also taken along, making them move swiftly over large distances. Ten Kate did not think the Apaches were very good riders, and remarked that their wooden stirrups were short and thus rode with their knees drawn up. Ten Kate found the riding style of the Apaches inelegant, with their trunks and heads in perpetual motion, and their arms flapping up and down their bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeren manchet die dient als bescherming van paardenhoeven, met name in rotsachtig terrein.\r\nPaardenschoenen werden gebruikt bij overvallen en lange tochten, of na dergelijke tochten. Zij waren gemaakt van ongelooid runder- of paardenleer. Apaches gebruikten paardenschoenen sinds ongeveer 1750. Spanjaarden en andere Indianen uit het Zuidwesten gebruikten ook paardenschoenen. Voor muilezels en honden werden kleinere schoenen gemaakt. (Ferg 1996:81)\r\n\r\nFerg, Alan (ed.)\r\n1996[1987]\r\nWestern Apache Material Culture.
