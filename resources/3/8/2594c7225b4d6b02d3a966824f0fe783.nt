This beautifully carved specimen stands out among other known or presumed 19th century masks because of its provenance and its superb condition, vibrant colors and traditional designs.\r\n\r\nCollected in a Yoeme barrio in La Paz, Baja California, during the Easter ceremonies from March 18-22, 1883, it is unknown if the mask was made in La Paz or came from one of their distant indigenous eight central pueblos or communities along the Rio Yaqui (Hiak Vatwe) in Sonora, Mexico – the Yoemem homeland. In the 1800s, Yoemem were brought to southern Baja to dive for pearls. When that endeavor faded their strong work ethic took them to mining jobs and work on the docks.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to envision a pahko’ola dancer tucking his favorite mask into his bag of belongings in preparation for the trip across the Gulf of California for an extended stay or a permanent move. Perhaps pascolas made special trips to La Paz for Easter or other ceremonies (pahkos) much like pascolas from the Hiak Vatwe villages make trips to southern Arizona for pahkos today. All Yoemem pahkos require at least one pahko’ola (old man of the ceremony [pahko]) to open and close the pahko as well at entertain the crowd. Yoemem use the terms pascola/pahko’ola, pascolas/pahko’olam and ceremony/pahko depending to whom they are speaking.\r\n\r\n\tDesigns which include crosses, stars, dots, triangles, scrolls, geometric shapes and plant and animal forms act as blessings for the pahko’ola, his family, his tribe and for mankind as well as reminders of ancestors, the flower world (sea ania) and the wilderness world (yo ania) with all of its animals and plants sacred to the Yoeme. Crosses symbolize protection from evil and are the most ubiquitous elements on pahko’ola masks.\r\n\r\n\tRemarkable as this mask is, it could easily be worn today by a pahko’ola at a Yoeme pahko and it would certainly fit in among the contemporary masks of the 21st century. Some of the differences are as follows; though masks today can exhibit forehead and chin crosses, they usually only have one on the forehead. The beard and brow hair today are usually thicker and longer and the border on contemporary masks usually consists of a band of triangles or half circles that encircle the mask. Side designs are usually single elements such as lizards, flowers or other animals. The most striking difference is the design treatment under the eyes. This mask boasts half circles while today’s masks display various size triangles. Another deviation is the treatment and insertion of the beard and brow tufts. Today, hair tufts go through the mask wall, through poked or drilled holes with the tufts securely tied on the interior with string or cord. This mask, as most 19th century and early 20th century pahko’ola masks, has the hair tufts inserted into holes that do not go through the mask wall and the tufts are secured with wooden pegs on the exterior of the mask.\r\n\r\nFrancisco Martínez (deceased), a well known Yoeme pahko’ola mask carver from Old Pascua village in Tucson, Arizona was shown a photograph of this mask in 2004. He estimated the mask was carved about thirty years ago (1970s). When told the mask was over 120 years old, a smile appeared on his face and he said that he was glad masks had not changed that much over time and that the tradition was still intact.  He added that his uncle, who taught him to carve, used to make masks very similar to this one. \r\n\r\nThe words, the smoke, the dust, the music, the dance and the reverence this mask was part of exudes through the wood and explodes into a myriad of expressions still palpable today. The mask’s beauty and craftsmanship combined with an understanding of the pahko’olam who wore it while fulfilling cultural obligations at Yoeme pahkos in the 19th century make it a masterpiece, on multiple levels, in Native art from the Americas. \r\n\r\nThomas M. Kolaz\r\nArizona State Museum, Tucson, AZ; 2015\r\n\r\n362-12, 56, 57, 58 Pascola artifacts\r\nThe Hispanicized Indian term pascola is derived from the Cahitan pahko o ola, meaning \"old man of the fiesta\" (Spicer 1940:174), and the term refers as well to the character as to the dance he performs. Masked ritual clowns have been a part of Yaqui ceremonials for many centuries, and later developed into the pascolas. They perform a variety of roles at different ceremonial occasions: as clowns, ceremonial hosts, and dancers at different occasions, including Easter festivities, and are central to Yaqui ethnic identity (e.g. Spicer 1940:182-189; 1954:76-77,183-184; Barker 1957). The dance is syncretistic, combining traditional Indian and Christian elements. Ten Kate's description of a Yaqui pascola performance, although rather short, is one of the earliest anthropological accounts of this dance that is performed annually during the season of Lent, shortly before Easter. The pascolas and their performances have drawn widespread interest as a multitude of publications testify, including several scientific studies from different perspectives (e.g. Bogan 1925; Spicer 1940:173-203; Painter 1986; Griffith and Molina 1980). Bronislaw Malinowski who was in Tucson in 1939 to consider a position with the University of Arizona's Anthropology Department, wrote a functionalist analysis of the Yaqui Easter Fiesta and the pascolas he saw perform at Old Pasqua Village (Troy 1998:178-180). In the 1930s an interdisciplinary group of researchers from Texas and Harvard University did fieldwork among the Sonora Yaquis and gathered a contemporary collection of artifacts for the Texas Technological College in Lubbock (now: Texas Tech University) and the Peabody Museum in Boston (Holden et.al. 1936:11).\r\n(Pieter Hovens 2008-09)\r\n\r\nHouten dansmasker, zwart geverfd met ingesneden versiering die is opgevuld met rode en witte kleurstof; wenkbrauwen, gezichtshaar en baard van paardenhaar. Gedragen tijdens pascola-dans, die vooral wordt uitgevoerd tijdens Pasen. De danser is bij voorkeur een oudere man, die satirische, moraliserende, vermakelijke of kritische verhalen of epigrammen zingt. Tijdens de dans draagt hij een soort tambourijn, (sonagé) waarmee hij op de linkerhandpalm slaat, en aan de enkels rammelaars van vlinderpoppen, gevuld met kleine steentjes. Hij danst op de muziek van een viool en een fluit. Het masker werd verzameld bij YAQUI-Indianen in La Paz, op het schiereiland van Californië. Zij horen echter thuis ten ZW van Guaymas, in de provincie Sonora, Mexico." .
