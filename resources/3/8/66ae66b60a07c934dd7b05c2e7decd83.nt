<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7208-1> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "`History of the World' is a series created by the Mohawk photographer, film maker, and mixed media artist  Shelley Niro (b.1954) regarding the question of colonial presence in Northeast North America, and more generally in North America. Niro is a member of the Kanienkehaka (Mohawk Nation), Turtle Clan, from Six Nations of the Grand River Territory. The piece is a series of four long photographs with coloured borders from the four sacred directions (red, yellow, white, black) which include images of fossils, coins and the land. The four works represent elements of landscape in the region where Shelley Niro comes from, and refers to earth, land, sky and water. These are combined images which prominently feature the ‘Indian Head’ or ‘Buffalo’ nickel still circulating as US currency still but minted between 1913-1938, as part of a series commissioned by Roosevelt and designed by James Earl Fraser. As Niro notes, the ‘Indian Head’ profile was based on a series of portraits of Indian leaders. \r\nBy prominently including the Indian Head/Buffalo nickel, Niro makes a pointed reference to the iconic nature of the ‘Indian’ and the ‘Buffalo’ in the North American psyche, and in representations of America, at a time when the indigenous population itself was severely under pressure. The coin was minted after the end of the ‘Indian Wars’ of the late 1800s fought on the North American plains and culminating in 1890 with the massacre of Lakota Sioux at Wounded Knee. This battle and the near eradication of the buffalo (in the 1870s c. 5,000 buffalos were killed per day) was part of the systematic attempt by the United States government to encroach on indigenous territories and thus claim them, resulting in the creation of reservations for those vanquished. These images, therefore, use the symbols of ‘Indian-ness’ in conjunction with images of land to both signal the interplay between the pervasive interpretation of indigenous Americans in North American national stories on the one hand, and the impact that these national stories had on such indigenous populations on another. However it equally advances an argument about sovereignty (over land) and ‘survivance’ ( of culture). Survivance is the term coined by Gerald Vizenor, the Anishinaabe scholar who argues that creativity has guaranteed the continuance of indigenous culture and beliefs.\r\nThe photos are placed on top of images of water, air, land and earth taken from Ontario Canada. They are framed in the colours of the four directions: North (red), East (yellow), South (white) and West (black). This is derived from Lakota culture but has been adopted by many indigenous Americans representing nationalism and unity." .
