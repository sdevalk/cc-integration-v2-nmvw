<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/c8f319339bff93d17f24cdd39a4b3e59> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "A necklace made of rattan and feathers. The abak ngalou of the shamans are made for them by their master (paumat) and hung with amulets they obtain form the spirits during their initiation. The necklace is full of magical power and never to be sold; Reimar Schefold was given this modern version as a present.\r\nThe shaman (kerei) holds the only specialized position to which a Mentawai man can accede. His ability to “see” and to communicate with souls and spirits is the magical result of a several months long initiation ceremony. This enables him to perform his multiple tasks in ritual and healing. Specific adornments are connected with his position, and others are peculiar to his wife who upkeeps together with him various taboos that are in force during his activities and seconds him in certain ritual tasks. She is also referred to as kerei." .
