The fibres are plaited into a cord. Most of them hang loose as fringes, but some are plaited into long cords. Plaited into the main cord at the upper end are also strips of red and blue cotton. \r\nThe aprons were only worn by women. The apron has two parts, the shorter one was worn in the front and the longer one in the back. Both parts were fixed by a belt. Often women wear these fibre aprons underneath a cloth of some fabric.\r\nFibre aprons belonged to the everyday clothing of women and girls, but as this apron is further decorated with cotton, it was probably worn on festive occasions and dances." .
