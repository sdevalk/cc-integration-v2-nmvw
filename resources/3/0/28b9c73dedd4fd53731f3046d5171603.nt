Many were also used as parching trays to dry seeds and beans, including opimpi, mesquite beans. This harvest was put in the tray, mixed with hot charcoal, shaken and stirred to speed up the process and prevent the food and tray from burning. This treatment not only aided preservation of the food but also improved the taste.\r\n\tThe preparation of the materials for making trays was carefully done, and the stripping of the bark from the willow took much time and effort. The weaving was executed precise, the stitching tight, resulting in an even and uniform surface. The coils for this tray have a three-rod foundation and the coiling is done clockwise. The basket shows several signs of use, including a few scorched areas, and the blackened remains of organic material between the stitched coils.\r\n\tApplied just below the rim, on the outside of this basket, a number of open diamonds are arranged in pairs, but have become damaged and rather faded.\r\n\r\n362-118, 119, 191, 192 Chemehuevi basketry\r\n\tEarly documented collections of Chemehuevi basketry are at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County (the Ammann collection from 1898-1913; Kania 2007), the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC (acquired from the Fred Harvey Company in 1903; Mason 1904:518-519, plate 232), the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, PA (the George Wharton James collection, acquired in 1902), the Hearst Museum of Anthropology in Berkeley, CA (collected by Kroeber between 1904 and 1908), and the Field Museum in Chicago, IL (acquired by George Dorsey in 1904; Kania 2006:70). Thus, the specimens Ten Kate collected on the Fort Mohave Indian reservation in 1883 are probably the earliest documented Chemehuevi baskets.\r\n\tThe study of Chemehuevi basketry has been neglected by anthropologists. Singular observations on the craft are scattered throughout the literature, but do not provide a clear or coherent, let alone a complete picture (cf. Smith and Simpson 1964:15-32). Clara Lee Tanner (1983:216-225) provided the best initial study, based on an analysis of the large Birdie Brown collection at the Colorado River Indian Tribes Museum in Parker, Arizona, as well as many items from other museums and private collections. Santa Fe gallery owner John J. Kania must be credited with several subsequent studies of various collections (2006, 2007).\r\n\tThe four Chemehuevi baskets collected by Ten Kate fit the characterization of the tribal craft by Tanner. All are coiled clockwise, using a three-rod foundation, and have decorative designs. These were considered as the personal property of weavers and one did not infringe thereon. Although some authors have stated that the Chemehuevis only made coiled baskets, others have qualified that statement (Smith and Simpson 1964:16; Dalrymple 2000:57-67). Ten Kate witnessed twined conical burden baskets and winnowing trays as still being produced in 1883, types typical of traditional Numic basketry from the Great Basin. He was correct in assuming that the Chemehuevis traded their fine basketry with other Colorado River tribes. When the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1883, Chemehuevi basketmakers also produced ware for sale to travelers and tourists.\r\n\r\nColor photo\r\nChemehuevi basketmaker; postcard (RMV col. 5910-44)\r\n\r\nEen schaal om zaden te roosteren, in een spiraal met de klok mee gevlochten, een karakteristiek kenmerk van Chemehuevi vlechtwerk. Drie wilgentenen vormen de basis van de spiralen, die met wilg zijn omwikkeld.\r\nOm te verkomen dat bonen en zaden beschimmelden tijdens de opslag, moesten ze geconserveerd worden. Dit gebeurde door de bonen en zaden in een ondiepe schaal te drogen. Na toevoeging van hete kolen werd het mengsel enkele malen omgeroerd of opgeklopt om de korrels gelijkmatig te verhitten en te voorkomen dat de mand zou verschroeien. Als de bonen voldoende geroosterd waren, werden de kolen en asresten verwijderd en het voedsel opgeslagen. Mezquite-bonen ('opimpi'), een belangrijk basisvoedsel, werden zo behandeld, evenals de bonen die blanke Amerikanen introduceerden. Het roosteren verbeterde ook de smaak van de bonen en zaden." .
