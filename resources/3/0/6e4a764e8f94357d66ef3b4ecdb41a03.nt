Already in 1879 Colonel James Stevenson (1883:370) noted that wooden utensils were becoming rare. Although most spoons and ladles were simple, the elongated shape of this spoon is rather elegantly carved. Others were decorated with carvings, usually at the end of the handle (cf. Fane 1991:102).\r\n(Hovens 2007-08)" .
