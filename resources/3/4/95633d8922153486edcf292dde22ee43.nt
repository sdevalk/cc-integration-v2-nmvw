In the centre of the whole, the main entrance through the western gallery in the outer enclosure is shewn, and a portion of the causeway leading up to the inner buildings of the temple. Some idea may be formed from the perspective of the picture, indicated in the minute dimensions of the distant tower, of the vast area that this building encloses, and of the years of toil which it represents, if we look upon it simply as an accumulation of huge unwieldy blocks of stone, that have been cut from the quarries, and conveyed, by some powerful mechanical agency, a distance of 40 miles across a burning plain.\r\n\r\nin: Album \"The antiquities of Cambodia a series of photographs taken on the spot With Letterpress Description By John Thomson, F.R.G.S., F.E.S.L., Edinburgh: Edmonston & Douglas MDCCCLXVII\"; opgenomen in KIT Library ILS (RF-279) page 55." .
