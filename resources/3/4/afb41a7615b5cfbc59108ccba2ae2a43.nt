It is hewn from one piece of wood and has two parts to it. First, there is the handle, which has a decorated tip and has two stripes, red and white. The other part is the blade which is shaped like a long and pointy leaf. It is coloured in black, red and white. \r\nThe person paddling looks into the direction of travel. \r\nIt is not known whether there are different paddles for women and men." .
