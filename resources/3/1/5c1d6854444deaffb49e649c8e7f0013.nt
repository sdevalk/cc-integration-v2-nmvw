<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/987d4630f70c7f292fb24be8f8277a3d> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Tejaâ€™s work is inspired by the characters in Hindu epics such as Ramayana, since as a child he loved watching perfomances of wayang kulit theatre, but his narratives reflect on the modern world in Bali, such as the impact of tourism. He is mostly attracted to very strong, fierce full  characters, who in his paintings show that they also have a very soft side to them. He also likes animals, and often paints fables from the Tantri Kamandaka. \r\nKumbakarna relaxing on the beach is inspired by the story of the brother of the demonic king Rawana in the Ramayana epic, who has a very big body, and is attacked by monkeys who help Rama to save his wife Sita out of the hands of Rawana. The figure is a bule, a white tourist, who is sunbathing on the beach. His body is huge, like the demon Kumbakarna. The monkeys are disturbing his rest, like they also do in the touristic Monkey Forests in Sangeh and Ubud and the temple Ulu Watu." .
