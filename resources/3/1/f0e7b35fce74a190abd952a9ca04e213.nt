<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-5715-2623> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Archaeological evidence indicates that during prehistoric and Historic period in the Southeast basketry included mats and baskets used for storing, transporting, gathering and processing food and interring the dead. Basket making is a women's craft with specific rules designating which women are allowed to make a special kind of basket. For example, grandmothers or older women past menopause can make certain baskets to protect the power of the medicine. The traditional raw material for basketry in Louisiana is cane (Arundinaria tecta) but is has almost disappeared because of changing agricultural practices. Since 1920's the needles of the Longleaf Pine (Pinus palustrus) have proved to be a sufficient replacement of cane. At the same time, the raffia palm fiber (Raphia farinifera) substituted the elm inner-bark (Ulmus) which was used to stitch the coils together. Today practically all Koasati basketry is made of coiled pine needles with raffia. \r\nA common feature of North American Indian child care is carrying the baby around in a cradle. This way, the baby was safe and easy to handle. Also, protective amulets and fetishes were attached to the cradle to guarantee the baby's safety. Cradles had other functions as well besides carrying the baby around; they also made safe beds for the babies and indicated the social status and ethnic identity of the family. The shape of the cradle depended on the natural surroundings and living conditions of the user: different peoples made different cradles." .
