Daarin zijn waterpoelen, waterbronnen, voedsel, wild en goed jachtterrein te vinden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEast Kimberley\r\nFrom 1880 on, this area has been occupied by white colonists. Over-grazing destroyed the ecological balance of the country. Once in a while the Aborines speared cattle for food. This resulted in conflicts. As in many other area's the Aborigines were forced of their land. During the first 50 years of colonisation, about half of the Aboriginal people of the East Kimberleys were murdered. Aboriginal men used to work as stockmen on the cattle stations. In 1969, things became worse when a new law demanded the payment of equal wages for black and white workers. Most Aboriginal stockmen were fired and became homeless as a result. With government assistance these Aborigines established the Warmun community at Turkey Creek, which is now the most important art centre in Kimberleys. In their paintings the major theme is the land and location with a special historical or spiritual meaning. The landscape is depicted in profile and different perspectives are used. Whewreas the central desert artist depict mountains as flat circles, the East Kimberley artists paint them in profile as conical shapes. The edges of the paintings are often decorated with a line of dots, which are also used to emphasise main issues in the painting. The art works are done on linen with natural ochres, mixed with a binder. Sometimes artists mix the colours. \r\n\r\nTurkey Creek and Kununurra,\r\nPainting on canvas and linen done in natural ochres.\r\nCultural and artistic renewal is typical of the art of this region. The originality and high standard of these paintings has made them well known and appreciated. Mountains, rivers and baobabtrees are abstractactly depicted in these works. Especially appealing are painting of the Bungle Bungles: conical shaped mountains east Warmun (Turkey Creek)." .
