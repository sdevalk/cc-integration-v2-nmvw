<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/62d88dabd9ed640861b158aabd3ab038> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Between 7-14 September 2019, the Osage/Cherokee/Muscogee-Creek painter and muralist Yatika Starr Fields (b. 1981) was an artist-fellow at the Research Center for Material Culture at the Museum Volkenkunde (National Museum of World Cultures). During the course of seven days he painted the mural `Accommodating Strength: Our Lands, Our Heart'. The mural was commissioned to announce and be part of the new exhibition `First Americans' to open in Museum Volkenkunde in 2020. \r\nThe highly figurative mural is reflecting on the resilience and entangled of histories of Europeans and indigenous North Americans. Painted in public, the mural shows five figures who emerge as in dialogue with each other, and entangled and adorned with sage, illuminated by the sun, and amidst items important to indigenous North American culture, as well as a compass symbolic of European ideas of discovery and colonisation. Depicted are shells, the materials of adornment and inter-indigenous trade, porcupine quills, the component of many indigenous art forms, and textiles worn by Osage women showing ribbon work. The figures are all-in motion gesturing towards each other, several flying over the work. \r\nIn preparing for the work, Fields visited museums in Italy, France and the Netherlands looking at colour and composition, and devising a work to speak of the resilience and creativity of indigenous Americans in the past and in the present. \r\nTalking about why he creates public art, Fields notes “Everyone gets to see it, everyone gets a hand in it, and everyone gets to own it”. The mural can be seen from the road, cycle paths and canals. Many have walked past it in Covid times, had meetings near in the open air and cycle past the museum to see it in different light." .
