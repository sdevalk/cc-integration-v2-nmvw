It is only played by Outer Baduy boys and men.\r\nThe Baduy are a group of approximately 12.000 people, who live in west Java (Kanékés village, Kabupaten Lebak, Province of Banten, Indonesia). Their community is divided in the Outer- and the Inner-Baduy. The Inner-Baduy live very isolated, following strict rules.\r\nDuring several periods of fieldwork between 1976 to 2016, Wim van Zanten collected these instruments of the music he was studying, and brought them back home to use as study-material. Especially the flutes he played often, because they offered him musical information. After finishing his research and publication he donated these to the National Museum of World Cultures." .
