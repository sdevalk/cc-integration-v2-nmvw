The legs are very short because they were broken off during the ritual myth re-enactment. The object is richly decorated with feathers and coloured yellow with red and black dots. The eyes are indicated by red abrus pips. Kadivuk is an essential part of the dema-performer's outfit. \r\nThis ritual object was obtained by Father J. Verschueren during a ritual celebration in Wajaw (Kumbe-river) in December 1958. During the performance this kadivuk was thrown by dema-performer to the audience (that is why the legs of this figure are broken).\r\n\r\nThis symbolical gesture was a re-enactment of one episode of Marind mythology narrating the adventure of dema Mahu (Mohue), who dwells in the village Waan (Muting area) near a big water well which is there till these days. The local people made it difficult for Mahu and did not invite him to one of their big ritual celebrations. To revenge himself he would dress up in his best clothes with all his dema-attributes and decorations and in the evening he would come in his complete dema decoration to the celebration. Then all of the sudden he threw his iguana to the people. Many of the villagers were hit and died. After this, Mahu returned calmly to his village, where he disappeared forever in the well, which bears his name till today.\r\n \r\nOne of the female characters in Marind mythology is the iguana dema Upikak, who holds the island Habe (a small island near Birok) between her jaws. Wirz (1922-25, II: 102) suggests that \"she must be identified with the bank on the north side of the island. The bank is the iguana's body, its jaws the steep rocks rising from the sea\" (Van Baal, 1966: 275). According to another myth Upikak was a girl living on the Habe Island who has changed into an iguana. Later she married Aramemb (yam dema) and bore him the wallaby dema, Samanimb (ibid.: 276).\r\n\r\nThe iguana ornament represents both the Kai-ze and Ndik-end clan totem. It is even possible to say that it is a totem of the Aramemb phratry as a whole (ibid.: 307). Its ritual significance and cultural symbolism is rooted in the Marind mythology. In the myths kadivuk is sometimes referred to as to the midget crocodile because of its resemblance with crocodile. Iguana image can be also represented on the taboo-signs.\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 28.11. 2006" .
