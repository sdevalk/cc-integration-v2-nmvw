They used both fine quills to embroider curvilinear designs and folded and sewed flattened quills to hide to form rows of complex geometric patterns. After contact, moccasins, bags, and other hide items were further enriched by borders of small white glass beads and silk ribbon trim, often sewn on to hide smoked to a dark brown or blackish colour which set off the decorative elements (cf. Morgan 1850:68-69; 1852:94; FIA 1975:xxxv,41-42; Thompson 1977:124-125,144; Lyford 1982:28-29; Phillips 1984:44-45; Tooker 1994:115-116; Brasser 1976:116,118,153; 1998:49; Hall 2001; Coe 2003:216-218). By the middle of the nineteenth-century, Hodenausaunee women were making moccasins with multicolored floral patterns of raised or \"embossed\" beadwork sewn to velvet cloth backed with stiff paper or cardboard and then applied to the vamps. The cuffs could be treated the same way or covered with dark colored velvet and edged with ribbon or cotton tape. The sculptural, low-relief effect of the beadwork was achieved by stringing an excessive number of beads on the thread. The textured effect of the beadwork was often enhanced by the use of different sizes of beads and by the addition of cylindrical and faceted beads (Orchard 1929:153-157; Brasser 1976:43; Gordon 1984; Phillips 1990, 1998:225). Although probably produced in many of the Hodenausaunee communities, raised beadwork was particularly typical of Tuscarora and the Mohawk work. Moccasins made in this style were not only sold to tourists, but also acquired by aboriginal people from different nations and worn as part of formal dress.\r\n\tAfter the Civil War the federal governments of Canada and the U.S. embarked on a policy of directed assimilation, using Christianization and education as a two-pronged strategy designed to eliminate the vestiges of indigenous culture. Floral imagery in Native North American beadwork was understood by non-Natives to exemplify a rejection of traditional \"pagan\" images and beliefs and acceptance of a peaceful, civilized, and Christian way of life. During the second half of the nineteenth-century, floral designs also carried positive associations with ideals of womanhood and domesticity, explaining the why the floral beadwork used by Native women to ornament dress and household accessories was so popular with Victorian consumers (Phillips 1990:32-33; 1998:182-195).\r\n362-1, 6, 7, 13; 710-15, 26; 2012-10, 11, 12 Iroquois artifacts for the tourist trade\r\n\tBecause of the location of Niagara Falls within their territory, the Hodenosaunee (Iroquois) were the major suppliers of the souvenir arts sold there. Their main production was beadwork, applied in a number of distinctive styles and techniques to purses, moccasins, pincushions, and domestic ornaments that have been called \"whimsies,\" a term used for imaginative novelties by non-Native needleworkers during the Victorian era. Hodenosaunee people prefer to use the categorical term \"beadwork.\" Although Lewis Henry Morgan acknowledged the \"mixed character\" of these items, he also wrote that they \"furnish no slight indication of the artisan capacity\" (Tooker 1994:73).\r\nWomen's beadwork increasingly provided Hodenosaunee families with much needed cash income, and Hodenosaunee people consulted by Beverly Gordon, who has made the most extensive study of their beadwork, emphasized that many Indian families would not have been able to survive without manufacturing for the tourist market (Gordon 1984:65; Rickard 1992). Although production fell off during the twentieth century when other kinds of work became available, Hodenosaunee women have continued to make fine beadwork down to the present, both to ornament clothing worn by followers of the Longhouse religion and for sale. Contemporary Hodenosaunee regard beadwork as an important traditional art form (Hill 1994) and it is currently experiencing a revival.\r\nOn the Tuscarora Indian Reservation or at Niagara Falls Ten Kate purchased a number of Tuscarora \"whimsies,\" domestic ornaments of Euro-American derivation embellished with beadwork and moosehair embroidery (cf. Gordon, 1984, 1986; Harding 1994; Bol 1998:82-86,88; Phillips 1998:228-240). All the beadwork Ten Kate donated to the World Museum in Rotterdam have a cardboard base, covered with cloth of various colors with red clearly preferred. The bright and dark hued red and blue cloth set off the floral and zoomorphic designs (birds, butterflies), preferentially executed in white opaque raised beadwork.\r\nRuth Phillips (2009-09)" .
