<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/3607ec9cb2ff906913f3801bdba02960> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Een opvouwbaar kastje dat een heiligdom voorstelt, druk versierd met beschilderde panelen die voorstelling van de goden en hun heldendaden uitbeelden. \r\nOn the left hand side of the panel, on the door, you see a depiction of the moon god Chandra (also known as Soma). Across from this depiction, on the upper right hand side of the right door panel, there is a depiction of the sun god Surya. \r\nThe rest of the door panels are various depictions of the ten avatars of Vishnu. In Hindu mythology, Vishnu comes down to earth in nine forms, and we wait for a tenth form to descend. When Vishnu descends as an avatar, it is usually to fight a battle or to right an injustice. His avatars also exemplify extraordinary god-like figures, such as Rama or Buddha. His avatars, in order, are: 1. Matsya (fish) 2. Kurma (tortoise) 3. Vahara (boar) 4. Narasimha (man-lion) 5. Vamana (dwarf-god) 6. Parashurama (also known as Rama with an axe) 7. Rama 8. Krishna 9. Buddha 10. Kalki. Besides the depictions of Surya and Chandra, the panels on these doors show Vishnu himself (recognisable as the blue coloured god) beside an avatar of himself. \r\n On the left hand side panel, below the depiction of Chandra, there is a depiction of the lord Vishnu in his tenth avatar form, Kalki. Below that we see what is probably Vishnu as his fifth avatar, Vamana. Going to the left hand side we see Vishnu as what is probably his ninth avatar, Buddha, and under that we see Vishnu as his seventh avatar, Rama. The main, middle panel shows two images. The one on top is of Vishnu reclining on the cosmic snake, Shesha. According to some Hindu mythology, Vishnu is considered the maintainer of the cosmic order. The story is that while reclining on the universe in the form of Shestha, the snake, he can maintain order. When Shesha stretches out, the universe is created. When Shesha coils up again, it is destroyed, a new cycle of life must be ushered in and maintained. At Vishnu's feet you see his consort goddess, Lakshmi. Springing forth from Vishnu's navel is the god Brahma, known in some Hindu mythology as a creator of the universe, and he emerges here from Vishnu to create forms in the universe. \r\nBelow this panel, you see on the left hand side Hanuman, the loyal devotee of Rama, Vishnu in the centre, and Vishnu's 'vehicle' or animal consort, Garuda, the parrot. \r\nThese mythological accounts can be traced to what is known as 'Puranic' literature in Hindu traditions. Puranas are oral narratives that were also written down at later points in history, and deal with legends and myths, often related to gods and goddesses. There is incredible variation in Puranic literature, especially when it interacts with local stories and legends about local deities. As an object related to storytelling, the rich depictions around the mythology of Vishnu means that many different stories could be told from just one image from this panel. The story should not be seen as continuous: that one panel directly relates to or tells the story of the next one." .
