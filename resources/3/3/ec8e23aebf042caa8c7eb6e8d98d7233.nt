Hats, both contemporary and more traditional reflect the importance of headwear which is worn for everyday and special purposes, and are important to situations and culture which is not unchanging.\r\nThis fedora is handwoven such that the top looks plaited while the body of the hat is twinned using the three strand technique.\r\nCedar is a wood whose importance to the cultures of the Pacific Northwest is evident in its pre-eminence linked to its versatility with each nation using different elements of the tree to produce a range of art works and utilitarian objects. It is used for both utilitarian as well as ceremonial and spiritual purposes. Yellow cedar and red cedar are both present in coastal areas, with red cedar also present and harvested in the interior. Yellow cedar is a smaller and bushier tree and more restricted in terms of its coverage. Red cedar has anti-fungal properties and lightweight and a taler tree and is used for architectural and transport functions â€“ such as canoes, ceremonial poles. Yellow cedar has more pliable qualities and is more frequently used for clothing." .
