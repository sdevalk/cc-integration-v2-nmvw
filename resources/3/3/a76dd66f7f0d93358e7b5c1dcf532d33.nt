He was Nasser-al-Din Shah's eldest son, and the brother of Kamran Mirza Nayeb-Saltaneh and of Mozzafar-al-Din Soltan (who eventually became Mozzafar-al-Din Shah), but Mass'oud Mirza could not ascend as Shah as his mother was from outside the Qajar dynasty's family group. He served as governor of Esfahan, and is known to have had fourteen sons and eleven daughters." .
