But the occasional tailored buckskin shirt could still be seen, worn by an influential man who could afford such a garment. \"I noted the handsome chamois leather shirts with painted figures and long fringes just a few times, and I bought one from a young warrior for ten dollars\" (Ten Kate 2004:197). The Leiden shirt opens at the front, and closes with four mother-of-pearl buttons, and a fifth at the collar. The body, collar, sleeves, fringes, and serrated tabs were all sew together with sinew. The sleeve and body seams are highlighted with red paint, and just above the bottom fringe is a band of yellow paint. The most striking feature of this shirt is the painted design in the shape of a horseshoe encircling the neck with the arms coming over the top of the shoulders onto the front. Pendant from the arc on the back, and from the end of each arm on the front panels, are elaborate designs painted in black, blue, red, and yellow, with two abalone (Haliotis sp.) pendants sewn onto the designs.\r\n\r\n\tTailored buckskin shirts were modeled on U.S. Army officer's coats, and worn by important Apache Scouts (Ganteaume 1998). Such shirts were often decorated with fringe, beadwork, and silver buttons. But they usually do not exhibit the complex painted imagery seen on this shirt, which is more typical of the painted hides, sleeveless ponchos, and buckskin caps used in curing ceremonies.\r\n\r\n\tAccording to Apache beliefs, many supernatural beings have powers that can be called upon to protect the petitioner or, with the assistance of a medicine man, to cure a patient of disease or injury. Each medicine man worked with specific Holy Beings or powers. Painted medicine hides were employed to draw the attention and help of Holy Beings. Apache medicine men often acquired their knowledge individually, directly from a power, and painted their paraphernalia with designs that were often fully understood only by them.\r\n\r\n\tWithout the input of the medicine man who either painted, or supervised the painting of the images on Ten Kate's shirt, we can interpret the designs in only general terms. The horseshoe/arc may be a rainbow. The zigzag lines may be lightning, and the quartered circles with dots may be mountains with rain (Sutherland 1964:1097). These images hint at a connection to lightning power, which is among the strongest a medicine man can possess. The anthropomorphic figure with horns is doubtless a Holy Being. An abalone shell pendant with notched edges sewn to this figure's chest, and the two painted lines above it, make it appear as if the pendant was on a necklace around the figure's neck. The pendant worn by this Holy Being appears analogous to the pendant on the back of the shirt: both protect the wearer. The four colors used – black, blue, red, and yellow – remind the viewer of the holy nature of the images.\r\n\r\n\tTen Kate said the shirt's owner was a warrior, and it seems to have been created to provide supernatural protection. Ethnologist and U.S. Army officer John Gregory Bourke described a similar war shirt being worn by a White Mountain Scout the month before Ten Kate bought this one. It was made of buckskin by a medicine man, with painted ritual designs front and back (Sutherland 1964:1098).\r\n\r\n\tTen Kate did not record the reason why the owner sold this shirt. With raiding a thing of the past, perhaps he no longer needed its protection. Confined to the reservation, with limited means for making a living, the owner may have needed the money. Alternatively, the shirt may no longer have been efficacious. However, a power generally abandoned a person only when it was mistreated, or the person was too old or weak to use it effectively (Basso 1970:40), and Ten Kate said the owner was young. Regardless, the owner almost certainly \"decommissioned\" the shirt with a prayer to his power, as was recorded by other early anthropologists when they purchased powerful objects (Owen 1903:56, 174; Reagan 1930:303-306).\r\n\r\nAlan Ferg\r\nArizona State Museum, Tucson, AZ; 2015\r\n\r\nKeith H.

(at shoulders) 145 cm.; ca. 1880.\r\n\tTen Kate wrote: \"I noted the handsome chamois leather shirts with painted figures and long fringes just a few times, and I bought one from a young warrior for ten dollars.\" The transaction took place in June/July 1883 at San Carlos, Arizona. This tailored buckskin shirt is open at the front, and closed with four large, flat, commercial, mother-of-pearl buttons, and a fifth at the collar. The collar, sleeves and fringes were added; all sewing is with sinew. The fringes on the outer sleeve edges, and around the bottom, include serrated tabs. The sleeve and body seams are highlighted with red paint, and just above the bottom fringe is a band of yellow paint. The most striking feature of this shirt is the elaborate painted design: it is the shape of a horseshoe encircling the neck with the arms coming over the top of the shoulders onto the front. Pendant from the arc on the back, and from the end of each arm on the front panels are elaborate designs painted in black, blue, red, and yellow, with two abalone (Haliotis sp.) pendants sewn onto the designs.\r\n\tIf this shirt is not unique at the present time, it is certainly of an extremely rare variety: a tailored buckskin shirt with sleeves, of the type known to have been worn by Western Apache army scouts, but with elaborate painted imagery, of the type typically seen on buckskin caps and the painted hides and sleeveless ponchos used in curing ceremonies. Ganteaume (1998) has discussed Western Apache army scouts wearing tailored buckskin shirts that seem clearly modeled on U.S. Army officers' full-dress coats. For the army scouts, it seems to have been a simultaneous assertion of their identity as Apaches, as well as a visible statement of their alliance with the powerful forces of the U.S. military, and the high status derived from that association. And while these shirts may be elaborately ornamented with fringe, beadwork and silver buttons, they do not bear painted designs like the ones on the shirt acquired by Ten Kate.\r\n\tMost Western Apache ceremonial objects were decorated with stylized symbols. Many supernatural beings, according to Apache beliefs, have powers that can be called upon to protect the petitioner or, with the assistance of a medicine man, to cure a patient of disease or injury. Each medicine man had his personal group of holy beings or powers on which to call. Painted medicine hides, and very similar looking medicine \"shirts\" (which, at least physically, are essentially ponchos made by adding a headslit to the center of a medicine hide) were employed to draw the attention and assistance of holy beings and gaan (for examples, see Bourke 1892:plates VI, VII, VIII; Ferg 1987:color illustr. 1-lower right; Opler 1983a:fig. 7). Specific and correct identification and interpretation of the images on these items (as Ganteaume 1993 has endeavored to do) is made difficult by the idiosyncratic ways in which Apache medicine men acquired their knowledge and painted their paraphernalia with designs that were often understood only to them.\r\n\tWithout the input of the medicine man who either painted, or supervised the painting of the images on Ten Kate's shirt, interpreting the designs can be done in only the most general (and hypothetical) terms. The horseshoe/arc may be a rainbow. The zigzag lines pendant from it, and the several circular elements, may be lightning. The dot patterns may be rain. The anthropomorph with horns, on the left breast, is doubtless a Holy Being or gaan. An abalone shell pendant with notched edges is sewn to this figure's chest and the two painted lines above it make it appear as if the pendant was on a necklace around the figure's neck. The message seems clear that the abalone pendant worn by this Holy Being is analogous to the pendant on the back of the shirt, and both are giving protection to the wearer of the shirt. The palette of four colors used - black, blue, red, and yellow - may have been meant to invoke directional referents, or simply remind the viewer of the holy nature of the images.\r\n\tWe are, perhaps, on slightly firmer ground, in proposing that the presence of such ritual imagery on what for all other purposes would have been identified as a shirt for an Apache army scout, or an influential person, suggests that the shirt is not a ritual object, per se. Not for use by a medicine man. The possible rain, rainbow and lightning images hint at a connection to lightning power, which is among the strongest a medicine man can possess. That, combined with the general implication of protection implied by abalone pendants, lead us to hazard a guess that this shirt was indeed a functional item, but augmented with ceremonial designs intended to invoke supernatural protection. The most logical identification is therefore a shirt to be worn by a man going into a potentially (or known) dangerous situation, who will need protection. Ten Kate said the man was a warrior. Perhaps it was a man going on a raid or onto the warpath to kill an enemy. Such speculation is reasonable, but can probably never be absolutely confirmed by anyone now living.\r\n\tFinally, the fact that it was sold to Ten Kate suggests that the shirt was no longer needed, or the owner felt it was worth selling, or that the shirt was no longer efficacious. Ten Kate's mention that the man was young hints that it was probably not the last possibility: a power generally abandoned a person only when it was mistreated, or when the person was old and too weak to use it effectively (Basso 1970:40). No matter which, the owner almost certainly \"decommissioned\" the shirt with a prayer to his power, as occurred between 1901 and 1903 when Charles L. Owen collected two medicine shirts, and Albert B. Reagan collected three medicine caps, a medicine shirt, and a shield Owen 1903:56,174; Reagan 1930:303-306).\r\nWhile hunting, or raiding, or on the warpath, the attire of Western Apache men was basic and functional. They wore only a breechcloth and hightop moccasins, to protect the feet and legs from thorns and brush. A cartridge belt was fastened around the hips, from which pouches, awl or knife cases, and small sacks of food were suspended. Buckskin caps were prevalent in earlier days, but Ten Kate said they were still occasionally worn in his time, and their use on special occasions actually has lasted to the present.\r\n\r\n\tIn camp, nearly all men wore a cloth headband. Their dress showed an eclectic mix of Apache and European clothing items and styles, including blankets of Indian, Mexican or American manufacture, and sometimes shirts, pants, shoes, and cowboy hats. Women wore calico cloth \"camp dresses\" patterned after abundantly pleated Mexican and American dresses. It was obvious to Ten Kate that items of Western manufacture were replacing traditional costume, but he still saw fancy buckskin shirts worn by men, and both men and women continued to wear buckskin moccasins (khé) with rawhide soles and toe tabs, beaded buckskin pouches, and awl and knife cases. Although little jewelry was in evidence, he managed he collected a number of interesting necklaces.\r\n\r\nAlan Ferg; Arizona State Museum; 2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn de loop  van de 18e eeuw begonnen de Apaches met het maken van hemden naar het voorbeeld van kleding van Mexicanen en Anglo-Amerikanen. Dergelijke hemden waren soms mouwloos, of anders waren het mouwen verbonden aan een schouderstuk. Kenmerkend is de leren franje die op één of meerdere plaatsen in brede of smalle banden is aangebracht: langs de onderzijde, om het bovenlichaam, rondom de bovenarm en de polsen, op de naden van de mouwen en de zijden. Versiering wordt toegepast door beschildering en kralenwerk. Soms zijn de hemden geheel geverfd. Meestal droegen enkel prominente mannen een dergelijk kostbaar versierd kledingstuk.\r\n\r\nDe beschildering met motieven had speciale betekenis. Op dit hemd staat een menselijke figuur met een hoofdtooi waarvan twee hoorns deel uitmaken. Dit is de typische hoofdtooi van sjamanen, medicijnmannen die over bovennatuurlijke krachten beschikten om zieken te genezen. Het hemd heeft waarschijnlijk toebehoord aan een sjamaan. Deze rituele specialisten voorzagen ook de Apache krijgers van de noodzaklijke spirituele kracht om strijd te voeren. Daartoe veranderde hij hen symbolisch in vleermuizen die feilloos hun weg in het donker weten te vinden, obstakels weten te vermijden en niet te vangen zijn.\r\n\r\nPieter Hovens; 2005" .
