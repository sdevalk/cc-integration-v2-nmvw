It is an example of modern silver production in an urban context, i.e. Isfahan and tells the story of the transition to modernity in the major cities of Iran in the early 20th century.\r\nThe design is taken from European designs which became popular in the 19th century. These types of objects, such as tea spoons and hair brushes, are part of a shift to a modern way of life adopted from European habits. \r\nSilverwork is one of the most important crafts in Iranian history. Silver is mined in many places in Iran and since ancient times many parts of the world, including Europe, have traded with Iran for its silver." .
