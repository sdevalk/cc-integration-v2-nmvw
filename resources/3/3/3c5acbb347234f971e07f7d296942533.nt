<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7106-797> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Nyapanyapa's work has been more valued for the spontaneity and texture of her hand. She expresses her capacity to live in the moment in the freenes of her mark making. There is no calculation or even regard for the audience in her renditions. Their final appearance is almost random. They are an axpression of the movements of her hand, as they happen to have taken place on that particular day.\r\n\r\nIn early 2008 she made a dramatic departure from the previous conventions of Yolngu art. The grammatical tense which Yolngu sing/paint/discuss the creation forces that shape their world is unknown to non-Indigenous. Sometimes simplified as \"Dreamtime\" in English it conveys a temporal union between prehistory, the present and the distant future. All of these time zones are happening simultaneously! This is the tense in which the creation events happened/are happening/will happen.\r\nAll Yolngu art until this point was either sacred and in this tense or decorative. Decorative paintings were expressly 'ordinary' and without meaning or story of any kind." .
