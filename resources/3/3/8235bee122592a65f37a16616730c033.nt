<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-34-30> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The Leiden collection also holds a few natural history items for which the origin or collecting place is very difficult to establish. They include ‘diverse teeth’ and ‘diverse fish bones and nuts’.  These naturalia include possible bottlenose dolphin teeth (RV-34-32) that might have been collected in Tasmania and a pair of sperm whale teeth (RV-34-33) that might have been acquired in Tonga. I am unable to ascertain to which species of Dasyatidae a sting ray tail (RV-34-30) belongs. Natural history researchers suggest that two long bones in the collection (RV-34-31) originate from the pectoral fin of a fish rather than the stings of a stingray.  Some Tongans support the hypothesis that these natural history specimens were used as weapons for ceremonial killing." .
