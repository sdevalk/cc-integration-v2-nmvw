Women of the Lakon and Owaqol societies often use these plaques in their basket dances, after which they give them to relatives. The plaques made for these dances are of the best technical and artistic quality, women taking pains on producing a perfect basket. \r\nThe designs on coiled basketry, applied through the use of colored yucca strands to wrap the coils, can be geometric or flowing, abstract or naturalistic. They often represent concepts relating to fertility, such as kachinas, wind and clouds, rain and lightning, flowers and blossoms, ears of corn, etc. Until 1880 the designs were characterized by an indefinite geometry, but they soon became more focussed and varying, including an increasing number of naturalistic designs in the late nineteenth century when an outside market provided a valued emerging source of cash income (Wright 1979:68; Tanner 1983:54; Teiwes 1996:51-59; Nichols 2000:154-157,224-225). The faded central design on 362-179 possibly represents a flower or a star. Plaques RMV 362-180 and 181 exhibit a design popularly referred to as \"whirlwind\", but to the Hopis it is a representation of the moon. They refer to this type of plaque as muy' yungyápu, or \"moon tray\" (Wright 1979:63).\r\n362-170 through 182 Coiled basketry\r\nMuch Hopi basketry is woven in a coiling technique in which round bundles of twigs and plant fibers are wrapped with thin splints of yucca leaves into a thick strand which is then coiled in a circle, and sewn together with a bone, wooden or metal awl. The first coil and last coil taper to facilitate the beginning of the basket at the bottom and finish it in a smooth manner at the rim. For the starting and ending coils, yucca is used as a filler because of the flexibility of the fibers, while for the remainder Galleta grass (Pleuraphis; Hopi: sühü or takashu) or rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus) is used. Because this type of coiled basketry is prevalent among the Hopis, Pimas and Papagos, a Hohokam origin has been suggested for this technique, the prehistoric occupants of the Gila and Salt River areas in south-central Arizona.\r\nIn the coiling technique Hopi women created flat plaques, shallow trays, deep bowls, and a great variety of small and large baskets in various shapes. Sometimes lids and handles were added, often based on external examples. Patterns emerged by using colored strands of yucca for the wrapping of the coils. Natural yucca colors were olive green from outer leaves, yellow from sun dried leaves, white from new center leaves which were frozen to bleach them. By using a variety of vegetal dyes, yucca strands could be colored black (black sunflower seed) and red.\r\nThe art and craft of coiled basketry survived especially on Second Mesa which was also the traditional center of manufacture. Coiled basketry was produced increasingly for the external market after the completion of the transcontinental railroad through northern New Mexico and Arizona in 1883. However, an even earlier type of innovative coiled product made since about 1872 were sombreros. Old coiled basketry was recovered during excavations at Walpi (Mason 1904:503-505, plates 30,93,215-216; Hough 1915:91-92; 1919:266-267, plate 38-41; Colton 1965; Mori 1972:55-80; Adovasio and Andrews 1985:37-54,91-99; Wright 1979:66-68; Tanner 1983:50-63; Whiteford 1988:144-149; Teiwes 1996:10-29).\r\n362-170 through 185, 362-188, 189, 190 Hopi basketry\r\nThe sedentary and horticultural Hopis produced a vast amount of basketry in different techniques, a tradition reaching back into prehistoric ancestral times labeled \"Basketmaker I, II and III\" by archaeologists, because of the prevalence of basketry artifacts at these sites. This era stretched the period from 1 A.D. until 700/750 A.D. Coiling, plaiting and wickerwork were the main weaving techniques for baskets, with twining a minor technique used for mats to wrap wedding blankets. The Hopis obtained twined baskets from the Utes in trade, but also traded their own baskets with neighboring tribes (Hough 1919:251; Morris and Burgh 1941; Adovasio and Andrews 1985).\r\n\tThe plant materials used in Hopi basketry offered a variety of natural colors and shades. Yucca splints from outer leaves are olive-green. Bleaching in the sun turned the splints yellow, while fresh inner shoots gathering during the summer months are almost white, and freezing these turned them even whiter. A variety of vegetal and mineral agents were used in boiling the splints to provide them with a various colors: kaolin limestone (white); sunflower seeds, sumac, navy and kidney beans, soot, lignite coal (black); navy and kidney beans, sunflower shells, trade indigo from Meso-America (dark blue); larkspur (Delphinium) (light blue); greenthread or Hopi tea (Thelesperma megapotanicum; Hopi: hohoisi), Navajo tea (Thelesperma subnudum; Hopi: siita) (orange-red); Thelesperma grass, alderbark, sumac berries, cockscomb (Rhinanthus minor) flowers, iron ochre (red); pink corn, amaranth, cockscomb, pigweed (Cycloloma atriplicifolium) (pink); cockscomb, sunflower seeds (violet); rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus; Hopi: siváapi) flowers, flowers of fetid marigold (Pectis angustifolia; Hopi: tu'i'tsma), ochre (yellow); rabbitbrush bark, copper carbonate (malachite and azurite) (green). Vegetal dyes tended to fade rapidly in sunlight. To assure the effective bonding between the fibers and dyes, and render the colored fibers more color proof, a variety of mordants were used, including alum, limonite, rock salt, copper carbonate, tannic acid, human urine, sheep manure, and smoke (Hough 1900; 1919:265; Whiting 1939:26-28; Colton 1965; Teiwes 1996:23-29,42-49).\r\nDesigns on traditional Hopi basketry are primarily symbolic, and only secondarily aesthetic. Most designs refer to religious ideas about fertility and include birds, feathers, clouds, rainbows, lightning, planets and stars, snakes, butterflies and flowers, and kachinas. These are represented in abstract and geometric form as well as more naturalistic ways, with a tendency towards the latter, especially in coiled basketry, where production for an external market is involved. This external market expanded rapidly with the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1882 (Hough 1919:268-270).\r\nThe Hopis used their basketry for a great variety of utilitarian, social, and ceremonial purposes. As domestic containers they held corn, flour, bread, beans, fruits, nuts, seeds, etc. In their ceremonies basketry sometimes played a significant role. Marriage customs involve reciprocal gifts of coiled plaques, laden with food, between the families of the bride and groom. The women's Lakon Society performed the Basket Dance, carrying several varieties of baskets, and distributing them at the end of the ceremony. At the occasion of the Powamu or Bean Dance, baskets are given to girls, and baskets are buried with eagles that are ceremonially killed. Part of marriage rites is the giving of basketry plaques, some with a specific marriage-design, by the bride's family to the family of the groom, in exchange for the wedding dress (Stephen 1939: 323,837; Wright 1979:64; Breunig 1982:10; Tanner 1983:49; Whiteford 1988:150; Miller 1989).\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)\r\n\r\nEen gevlochten schotel.
