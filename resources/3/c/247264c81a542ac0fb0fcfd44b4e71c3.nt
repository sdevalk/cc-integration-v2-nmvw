<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/50f83083bfedd251babe8b23bf756563> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Created for the 1999 commission at the Volkenkunde entitled Garden of Eden, or Beelden rondom Volkenkunde, Danish Contemporary artist Jens Haaning continued a series of works in line with previously explored themes of politics, immigration and identity. The piece at the Volkenkunde jumps off from his “Arabic Jokes” series, in Denmark. In this practice he engaged with local neighborhoods in Denmark which were the progenitors of alternative social practice: work class, immigrant, and “locals” neighborhoods. In this poster series piece, Haaning juxtaposes local Danish culture, a nude female woman, well recognizable from mainstream Danish tabloid culture, and positions the image next to Arabic words. This is a case of abilities in translation and what cultural codified symbols and elements can make of each other. The recognition of something familiar, such as the Danish woman, and the Arabic language presented something \"foreign,\" or not instantly recognizable for both parties. It allowed an opportunity of inclusion and exclusion; nothing is more affirming of inclusion than an ‘inside joke.’ This piece also signified importance through its activation in the public space, as it was taken outside of the institution of the museum and shared where it would have high visibility.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFor the piece at the Volkenkunde, entitled Turkish Jokes Haaning revisits this outside/in dichotomy. The artist had Turkish men record a series of jokes, which were then set to play every hour from loud speakers attached to the building. These jokes were meant to create a situation where the majority ‘Dutch’ person could not understand the language for a moment and the new ‘Dutch,’ perhaps Turkish, immigrant could feel for a moment connected to their surroundings, or even put in an advantaged position, above the ‘local.’ A sense of belonging is created for those who can understand and a sense of alienation for those who cannot." .
