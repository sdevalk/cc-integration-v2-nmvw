The outside of the shell is polished. It might have been a factor of importance which person touched food with this eating device. Some women were seen as holding a pair of them in their hands in certain dances.\r\n\r\nAs this exemplar is more longish and sharp at the edges, it could also have been used as a knife or scraper foor soft food." .
