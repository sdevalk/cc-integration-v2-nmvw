His brother, Tapara, came into the camp and enticed Bima to go with him into the bush, leaving Jinani asleep beneath a shady tree.\r\nDuring the day the sun crept around the tree and shone directly on the baby boy. That night when Purukupali returned he found his son badly dehydrated, and was furious at his wife's neglect of their child.\r\n\r\nWhen Tapara and Bima came into the camp together late in the afternoon a bitter fight ensued between the two men, during which both were badly hurt. To escape further injury, Tapara flew up into the sky and became the man in the moon. He looked down and saw Purukupali pick up his son and walk backwards into the sea, decreeing that from now on death, hithert to unknown to the Tiwi tribe, would now come to all people. In vain Tapara called out to Purukupali to let him come down and try to restore his dying child, but this request was refused, Purukupali continuing to walk in to the sea until the waves covered his head.\r\n\r\nBima changed into a curlew, and all night long she wanders through the camps along the beaches, crying out \"wai-ee\" in mourning for her lost child, her husband and her lover.\r\n\r\n...kwampini, the Honey Bird Man, was grief stricken by the loss of his daughter Bima and his grandson Jinani, and ashamed at her treatment of ...husband, the great and powerful first ancestor. So he organized a ceremony in Purukupali's honour, and this became the first Pukumani ceremony, the mourning ritual of the Tiwi, which is still performed today.\r\nHe directed the making of grave posts, bark baskets, ceremonial spears, woven paraphenalia to be worn as decorations, the smoking of huts and ...possessions belonging to the dead man, tabus and codes of behaviour to he observed by all relatives and participants in the Pukumani ceremony.\r\n\r\n...ys the number of graveposts to be made and placed around a man's grove is determined by his importance in the tribe. The ironwood posts are carved by workers who are not related to the dead man, and when completed (usually after six months) the ceremony takes place and lasts for three days. The spirit of the dead man is happy that he has been duly honoured and may now depart for the happy land, where everyone is young and healthy for ever.\r\n\r\nThe large bird represent Tokwampini the Honey Bird Man, which Tiwi people now refer to as the Dreamtime bird. It is one of Bede's most traditional and best works, dating from the late 1960's.\r\n\r\nArtist: Bede Tungutalum\r\nTribe: Tiwi\r\nCountry: Nguiu (Bathurst Island)" .
