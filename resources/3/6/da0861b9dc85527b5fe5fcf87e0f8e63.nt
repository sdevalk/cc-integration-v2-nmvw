The design consists of bands of stepped rectangles, suggesting motion by its whirling effect. \tAlthough willow was used in most baskets, the Chemehuevis preferred to harvest another plant for basketry material if available. They called it soo-hoo-vimp, basket weed (Van Valkenburgh 1976:15). However, it was rare, and its botanical identity could not be established.\r\n\r\n362-118, 119, 191, 192 Chemehuevi basketry\r\n\tEarly documented collections of Chemehuevi basketry are at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County (the Ammann collection from 1898-1913; Kania 2007), the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC (acquired from the Fred Harvey Company in 1903; Mason 1904:518-519, plate 232), the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, PA (the George Wharton James collection, acquired in 1902), the Hearst Museum of Anthropology in Berkeley, CA (collected by Kroeber between 1904 and 1908), and the Field Museum in Chicago, IL (acquired by George Dorsey in 1904; Kania 2006:70). Thus, the specimens Ten Kate collected on the Fort Mohave Indian reservation in 1883 are probably the earliest documented Chemehuevi baskets.\r\n\tThe study of Chemehuevi basketry has been neglected by anthropologists. Singular observations on the craft are scattered throughout the literature, but do not provide a clear or coherent, let alone a complete picture (cf. Smith and Simpson 1964:15-32). Clara Lee Tanner (1983:216-225) provided the best initial study, based on an analysis of the large Birdie Brown collection at the Colorado River Indian Tribes Museum in Parker, Arizona, as well as many items from other museums and private collections. Santa Fe gallery owner John J. Kania must be credited with several subsequent studies of various collections (2006, 2007).\r\n\tThe four Chemehuevi baskets collected by Ten Kate fit the characterization of the tribal craft by Tanner. All are coiled clockwise, using a three-rod foundation, and have decorative designs. These were considered as the personal property of weavers and one did not infringe thereon. Although some authors have stated that the Chemehuevis only made coiled baskets, others have qualified that statement (Smith and Simpson 1964:16; Dalrymple 2000:57-67). Ten Kate witnessed twined conical burden baskets and winnowing trays as still being produced in 1883, types typical of traditional Numic basketry from the Great Basin. He was correct in assuming that the Chemehuevis traded their fine basketry with other Colorado River tribes. When the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1883, Chemehuevi basketmakers also produced ware for sale to travelers and tourists.\r\n\r\nColor photo\r\nChemehuevi basketmaker; postcard (RMV col. 5910-44)\r\n\r\nEen grote mand, in een spiraal met de klok mee gevlochten, een karakteristiek kenmerk van Chemehuevi vlechtwerk. Drie wilgentenen vormen de basis van de spiralen, die met lichtgekleurde wilg zijn omwikkeld. Voor de decoratie aan de binnenkant, een zigzagpatroon van gestapelde blokjes dat de illusie wekt in beweging te zijn, is gebruik gemaakt van zwarte duivelsklauw.\r\nDe Chemehuevis waren onder hun buren bekend om hun goede mandenwerk, en fraaie exemplaren als deze dienden ook voor de handel, vooral met de Yuma-stammen verderop langs de rivier, de Mohaves en de Yumas." .
