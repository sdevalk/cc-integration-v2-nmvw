It was worn round the neck three times by grown-up man.\r\nOrnaments participate in highlighting the body and give value to men and women wearing them. Yet in daily life, clothes and ornaments are very simple. However, when social conditions are combined, and almost always during a public meeting outside of the village the situation changes. It is a matter of showing signs linked with the social membership, taking care of one’s appearance and exposing a part of the wealth acquired by exchanges." .
