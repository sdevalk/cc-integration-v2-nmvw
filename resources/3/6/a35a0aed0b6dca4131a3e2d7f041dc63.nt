On U.S. 85 about halfway between Santa Fe and Albuquerque, New Mexico.\nOne of the most beautiful of all the Pueblo Mission Churches, Santo Domingo was built 15 year before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, and still possesses records dating back to that time, 1605.\nThe church is built of massive adobe blocks, and some of its present furnishings also date back to 1605.\nOf deep religious significance to the Pueblo, many of the tribal ritual dances originate in the Mission. Visitors to the Pueblo are always welcome to worship side by side with the Indians.\nThis is the only church in the world whose facade is colorfully frescoed with symbolic Indian Panies." .
