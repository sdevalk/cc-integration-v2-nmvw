Wood from the root of a tree is made soft in the fire and then bent into a half-circle. The two ends are tied together with rattan strings to hold them bent. On one end there is a separate piece of bamboo attached. The bamboo cap is the actual beater and it can be exchanged when it's not usable anymore. It is fixed with a rattan cord. \r\nThe sago beater is used to beat the white starch out of the sago palm. \r\nIt is used by men, who stand while working with the beater. Several men from the same patrilinear kin group work together and assist each other. Two men stand next to each other and beat the pith while singing special songs. These songs determine the beat and refer to the sago. \r\nThe pith is then washed, cleaned and dried to extract the fine powdery starch.  This is the work of the women. The starch or flour is baked into cakes which can be stored for months." .
