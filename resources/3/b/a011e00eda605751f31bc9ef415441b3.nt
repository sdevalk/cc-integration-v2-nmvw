<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/R-4008> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "For the Volkenkunde contemporary art commission in 1999, Beelden rondom Volkenkunde, Meireles proposed and created the piece entitled the turn of the day in 112 worlds. The piece’s title is named loosely after the title of a book by Julio Cortazar, Around the Day in Eighty Worlds. In this piece Meireles sought two copies of a newspaper from 112 countries on the same day, February 14, 2001. For the commission he created a ‘sculpture’ meant to exemplify a totem like structure, of 112 newspapers stacked together under a glass case. In this first iteration the piece is meant to be seen for its form, as a sculptural piece. For the second iteration, Meireles digitized all the front pages of the newspaper into a sort of archive. This emphasized the content of the piece. He intended for them to be available at request for the public to read, as well as a part of the museum collection: the collection of one day in the world. \r\n\r\nThis cohesive cross section of the news in all parts of the world could be analyzed as a whole to point to a general zeitgeist. This is an especially captivating time to undertake the project as it coincides with the rise of “the new millennium.” Through this collection of newspapers, the artist effectively immortalizes a day in the world, and allows us to see, if we study close enough, the intricacies and connected global events which connect humankind together in seperate news stories. This archive style of collection, as art piece, serves both aesthetic function and categorization, and presents objective truth to be added in linkage to ethnography." .
