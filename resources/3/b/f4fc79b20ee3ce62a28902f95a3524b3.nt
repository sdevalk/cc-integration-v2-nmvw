<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/1afb10dd4708fe306ad1c3fc35a05be2> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This ceremonial dance ornament represents an ibis (ebob), possibly a black ibis. Its long beak, small head, long hull and tail are carved from a single piece of wood. The bird is largely decorated with coix seeds and abrus pips. Its eyes are also indicated by abrus pips. The parts without pips have been painted yellow. There are a few real feathers attached to the body, mainly on the sides and wings. On the bottom there is a hole to which a stick was attached by means of which the ornament was carried above the bearer's head. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \r\nAccording to the donor, children carried this object attached to a stick during the parade in honour of the marriage of Princess Juliana of the Netherlands. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            \r\nThis ceremonial dance ornament is the Kuna-hi Ndik-end (Yawima-rek) clan emblem representing a totemic ancestor/animal, an ibis bird whose ritual significance and cultural symbolism are rooted in Marind mythology.\r\nIbis belongs to the totem-relations of the Aramemb phratry (Yawima-rek clan). \r\nYawima is one of the Marind mythological rain-magicians, dongan-anem (thunder-maker) and ibis (ebob) is a metamorphosis of one of his sons. According to the myth, one day Yawima found some of his sons drunken with wati and in anger he started to beat them with a stick. As a result of that his sons changed into various birds. One changed into the ibis, because it waddles like an inebriated wati-drinker (Van Baal, 1966: 288-289).\r\n\r\nWith reference to the ebob dance ornament, Wirz described the imo cult tik ceremony held at Elebeme.  \"... Toward five o'clock six performers appeared, painted black from head to foot. In their hairdo they each had fixed a long, elastic rod (arib) with, on top, the black head of an ibis... . These dema-performers of the imo ... entered the village in pairs. ... With solemn paces they marched up and down, several times in succession, the long arib swinging above their heads. ... This went on all night, but before daybreak the performers... returned again with bullroarers. ... Then a great fire was laid in which all the discarded decorations were burned, so as to destroy even the last traces of sickness. ... They hoped that by now the tik had been definitely banned by chasing it into the sea\" (Wirz, M.A. III: 94f and van Baal, ibid.: 636-637). \r\nVan Baal suggests that the six performers with ibis decoration should not be called dema-performers, but ebob-ti (dancers with the ebob ornament).\r\n\r\nThe ibis decoration is typical for imo cult ceremonies. This also confirms another Wirz (M.A. III: 146-149) description of the imo mourning rite at Makalin. The main characters are three sobolu-ti (TM-number: 5969-480) (crowned with sobolu, cassowary-plumes decoration) and three arib-ti/ebob-ti (wearing arib with the head of a black ibis in their hairdo). While the old men sing yarut near the grave, the performers emerge from the bush and walk around the grave. They sing all together till the daybreak when the grave is re-opened. The corpse is cleaned with water and sperm and decorated with red pigment. Then the grave is closed again. \"Now the secret part of the ceremony begins [but the performers with the ibis ornament do not partake any more]...\" (Van Baal, 1966: 793).\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 20.11. 2006" .
