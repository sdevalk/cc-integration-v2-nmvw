Kangas are characterised by having a saying in Swahili that is printed on one edge of the cloth (for instance: \"I am not tired yet. I love you very much\"). Many of these textiles were printed in India especially for this vast African market, although nowadays kangas are mainly produced in Kenya and Tanzania. They remain extremely popular as they allow women to express their thoughts and moods via the choice of a suitable saying and colour combination." .
