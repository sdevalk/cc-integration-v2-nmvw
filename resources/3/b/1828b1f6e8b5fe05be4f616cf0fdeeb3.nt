These hollow log coffins were often used in pre-missionary times to store the cleansed bones of the deceased. \r\n\r\nThis is a hollow log coffin, painted in natural ochres. These hollow log coffins were used to store the cleansed bones of the deceased. The burial pole is made of the trunk of a Eucalyptus tree, which has been hollowed out by termites. The outside is painted with personal totem and clan patterns, as are the participants of the ceremony.\r\n\r\nAfter death an Aborigine is buried in a quite shallow grave during the first part of the mourning ceremony. Close relatives paint clan designs on the deceased's chest and coffin, and sing his spirit to it's resting place. 1.5 to 3 years later the last mourning ceremony is performed. The bones of the deceased are dug up, cleansed and painted with red ochre. In some areas in Arnhem land the bones are shattered. To the Aborigines the burial pole represents the skin and the flesh of the deceased. By placing the bones in the burial pole it is as if the soul has been replaced in the body. With song and dance the burial pole is placed upright in the camp with the bones inside, and left to decay naturally or occasionally sent back to the Clan country to be erected in the bush where the natural elements such as rain, wind and bushfire ensure that the spirit of the deceased will return to it's source." .
