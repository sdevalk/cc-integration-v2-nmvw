Unable to secure a job at Beswick, he later worked on a peanut farm near Katherine; then on a tin mine near the township of Pine Creek.\r\n\r\nHe spent the War years labouring for the military in Pine Creek. After the War he worked on Goodparla cattle station, mustering bullocks. He finally retired to various bush locations in the Alligator Rivers region and in western Arnhem Land. A full biography will appear in my forthcoming book.\r\n\r\nThe painting\r\n\r\nNamarnday is a general term for the various spirits which inhabit the vast rocky Arnhem Land plateau, a region which the Aborigines call \"the stone country\".\r\n\r\nIn the heat of the day, these spirits live in cool rocky holes. At night, namarnday emerge to leap, run and gambol about.\r\n\r\n\"The old people\" (past generations) often saw these spirits, and later painted their likeness either on rock faces or on the interior walls of their bark huts.\r\n\r\nThe artist has here shown a male namarnday with his two wives.\r\n\r\nThis piece was painted for Lance Bennett during one of his visits to the small Aboriginal community on Mudginberri cattle station, between the South and East Alligator Rivers, in the Dry season of 1966.\r\n\r\ncopyright Lance Bennett" .
