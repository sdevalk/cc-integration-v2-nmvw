<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/b7212afa9dceef153420552bb27157bb> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This hollowed-out hull outrigger canoe probably comes from Sialum Island. Dark (2009, 120, fig. 13.2d, 122) discusses a very similar model of an outrigger canoe made by Mr. Namongo (the master canoe builder) which is now in the Peabody Museum, Salem (L: 68, 5 cms.). Yet Dark did not write more about the use of this canoe because only the hollowed-out hull outrigger canoe type are now in use among the Kilenge. We can suppose that the unhollowed-out hull outrigger canoe type is more ancient than the hollowed-out one, because it is said that until Namor (ancestor who taught many things to the Kilenge) coming, the Kilenge and Siassi only had unhollowed-out canoes. M. Namongo also made a woven sail so this form of canoe may well have been sailed as well as poled according to Dark. The paintings decorating the prow and the stern were black, white and red.\r\nTo reach the mainland, Sialum inhabitants used unhollowed-out outrigger driftwood canoes. They used this craft to fish at night with torchlight and also to sail between their island and the mainland. Salium people have no timber forest and are dependant of the wood coming from Gulf Huon mountains thanks to the currents. Similar unhollowed-out canoes were noticed in the Fly river mouth area (see Neyret, 1974, vol. I, 108 ), in Fiji where they are called ulatoka or bakanawa, and in Santa Cruz Archipelago (see Neyret, 1974, vol. I, 81). The outrigger fastener are made with two post pairs crossed below the rails, characteristic for Melanesia." .
