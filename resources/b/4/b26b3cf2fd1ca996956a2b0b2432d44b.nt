<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/62d776d9a35f60aed96485c2a3577a95> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The Hohokam, the desert farmers of the Southwest, were centred in the middle Gila and Salt river drainage basins in the semi-arid Sonoran desert of Arizona. High temperature, liw humidity and little rainfall characterize the desert climate. Rainfall is usually less then 10 inches annually, most of wich comes during the summer storms. Little of it could be used by the Hohokam, a factor that toed them to the river system.\r\n\r\nThe Hohokam culture has been divided into four periods: Pioneer, 300 B.C.-A.D. 550; Colonial, A.D. 550-900; Sedentary, A.D. 900-1100; Classic, A.D. 1100-1450.\r\n\r\nPioneer Period\r\nThe Pioneer Period consists of four phases: Vakhi, 300 B.C.-A.D. 1; Estrella A.D. 1-200; Sweetwater, A.D. 200-350; Snaketown, A.D. 350-550.\r\nIn the Pioneer Period the three basic traits that mark the close of a nomadic, collecting stage were adapted: pit houses, agriculture and pottery. \r\nThe oldest houses were unusually large, 10-15 meters in diameter. Later in the period the houses were smaller. Most Hohokam structures were shallow and in many cases were constructed after removing the loose desert soil to the depth of a hard caliche layer. \r\nUtilizing the spring runoff from the rivers and the late summer storms, the Hohokam could produce two crops a year. They used well-constructed canals to irrigate the fields of economically useful plants, such as maize. Starting from the Estrella phase the Hohokam cultivated beans. In the Sweetwater phase they started to cultivate cotton. However, the Hohokam were not able to depend on only farm crops throughout the whole year. Saguaro fruit in the summer and mesquite beans in the fall provided important calories. Dependence on all kinds of animals gave them much needed protein. \r\nThe earliest ceramic products were simple, but well constructed. Most of the pottery was thin and plain, ranging in color from brown to gray and fired in an oxidizing atmosphere. Throughout the period there was a gradual shift from dark gray to a light buff background, and painted designs underwent a corresponding change in complexity of layout and composition of motifs. Ceramic figurines were manufactured by hand. Most figurines represent a human form, an idea that possibly came to them from Guatemala or western Mexico. Pioneer period figurines are crude with minimal modelling. Most of them were found in trash, while the later and more realistic ones are associated with cremations.\r\nStone and shell industries also started to take shape. Carved stone bowls are found in the Vakhi phase. Later in the Pioneer period and cumulating in the Colonial period with the most elaborate forms. A stone object the Hohokam were famous for is the axe. The axes were fitted with J-shaped handles in a groove that passed three-quarters around the head. These axes were more complex and more difficult to make than those of later periods.\r\n The Hohokam also practised shell industry from the beginning of the Pioneer period. Shell was used for rings, beads, bracelets and as material for mosaic. Shell was most likely obtained by collecting trips to the gulf and ocean shores, as well as by trade. Shell wastage shows that the Hohokam developed a unique shell industry and that finished products were exported.\r\nIn the Pioneer period cremation was practised rather than inhumation. Although inhumation was acceptable during all periods, it was not a popular alternative. None of the cremations from this period are of a primary type, the few remaining bones were placed with shattered vessels in a trench or pit. Later in the Pioneer period stone artefacts were also found with cremations.\r\n\r\nColonial Period\r\n\tThe Colonial period has been divided in to two phases: Gila Butte, A.D. 550-700; Santa Cruz, A.D. 700-900.\r\n\tThe Colonial period was a period of expansion. The arrival of new traits, such as the ball court, suggests contact with Mesoamerica. The Hohokam extended their territory to the north, east and the south. The reason for this expansion was the successful technique of irrigation farming, this produced food surplus and thereby increased the population. This technique was adapted to lowland environments. The result was a more productive use of the land than pre-Hohokam occupation.\r\n\tReflecting the expanding population villages became larger and more numerous. Houses were, like the Pioneer period, scattered trough the settlements. New forms of architecture were introduced from Mesoamerica: the ball court and the platform mount. They were organized around ceremonial and communal functions. The ball court was used for a semi-sacred game while the platform was used for religious activities. Both structures had the function of integrating a community by rituals and the exchange of goods. Most likely the ball court and the platform mount also reaffirmed the ties with Mesoamerica.\r\n\tThe irrigation canals became longer, narrower and deeper in the Colonial period. They provided a large increase in acreage under irrigation, sometimes they were primarily used as domestic water supply.\r\n\tDuring the Gila Butte phase Hohokam ceramics underwent a modification of form and painted design. Use of life forms and geometric forms increased. The percentage of painted ceramics to plain ware increases in this phase and legged vessels appeared. The figurines became more realistic and clothes and ornaments were added with clay. \r\n\tIn the Colonials period w\\stone work became more elaborate, although there is little change in the fashioning of utilitarian stone tools. Non-utilitarian tools are being carved or sculptured in the form of different kind of animals, such as snakes toads and birds. \r\n\tThe carving of shell also became more common in this period, and the artefacts and designs more varied. Shell beads increased in number and shell was used in mosaic, an art form that became more elaborated.\r\n\tCremation was still preferred over inhumation. By the Colonial period definite crematory areas are often distinguishable at large sites rather that simple random scattering of cremations throughout the villages.\r\n\r\nSedentary Period\r\n\tThe boundaries in this period remained stable, except for expansion to the north. An erupted volcano covered the area with a thin layer of cinder and ash, improving the farming situation.\r\n\tHouse forms were mostly rectangular, although a minor tradition of a square house with rounded corners also existed. Some plazas were constructed and houses were scattered around these plazas. Ceremonial architecture had the mist changes. The platform became often a structure solely constructed for religious functions.\r\n\tCeramic design and vessel form changed during the Sedentary period. Large storage vessels with the Gila shoulder (a sharp angle formed by the upper and lower parts of the jar) are common. Life forms are rarely present as painted design elements and geometric designs become more complicated. The human figurines consist solely of heads. Impressions in the clay suggest that the bodies were made of textiles or plant fibres.\r\n\tUtilitarian stone artefacts show little change, non-utilitarian objects however show less skill and less variety of form than in the Colonial period.\r\n\tA lot of the energy seemed to be diverted from carving stone to working shell. New artistic modes and techniques were introduced. Besides the techniques of earlier periods shells were painted and etched. The number of utilized species of marine shells also increased.\r\n\tAll types of cremation activity from earlier periods continued. In addition an occasional cremation was placed in a jar. Extended inhumation appears to be more common during the Sedentary period, a pattern that continues during the Classic period.\r\n\r\nClassic Period\r\n\tThe Classic period is divided in to two phases: Soho, A.D. 1100-1300; Civano, A.D. 1300-1450.\r\nThis period was one of great change with evidence of social interaction from several \r\nsources. Around 1150 the Sinagua moved south pushing back the Hohokam and bringing their traits in to the territory. About 1300 an other group migrated into the area: the Saladoans. They built multi-stored pueblo-like structures of adobe. The invasions of these two groups seem to have been peaceful. The Salado and the Hohokam appear to have existed peacefully in the same village. During this period the Hohokam started to change, because of these external influences. \r\n\tAlready by the end of the Sedentary period there was architectural innovation. The Hohokam were building wattle and daub houses in pits, but were also experimenting with new types of wall structures, such as solid clay walls. These types of structures were elaborated during the beginning of the classic. Even with these new and more complex architectural forms there was still no discernible village orientation. By the Civano phase multi-story houses, or \"great houses\" with massive clay walls enclosed in rectangular compounds were constructed. These structures also represent the intrusion of Puebloid architecture to the Hohokam. The most prominent example is the \"great house\" at Casa Grande. The function of these \"great houses\" is not known. They have been suggested as priests' houses, ceremonial structures, observatories, and communal storage houses.\r\nBall courts were still constructed, but were not so numerous anymore.\r\n\tCanals reached their larges extend during the Classic period. Although canals were not constructed in every region, suggesting alternative methods of farming, such as dry farming techniques, terrace systems and floodwater farming.\r\n\tCeramics also change in form and decoration. There is a decline in red-on-buff pottery and also the Gila shouldered vessel appears with less frequency. Life forms as decoration are absent, and designs are more geometric. At the same time undecorated ceramics, especially red were, increase.\r\n\tThere is no major change in stone utilitarian artefacts, with the exception of agricultural tools, which is explained by the change in techniques. Luxury stone items decrease in number and sophistication of craftsmanship.  \t \r\n\tBurial practices shifted to a preference for secondary cremations. Ashes were placed in jars, primary cremations are also occasionally found. Inhumation also increased in popularity during the Classis period and has been suggested as a Salado-introduced practice.\r\n\tThe end of the Classic also marks the end of the Hohokam. Villages were abandoned, probably because of a several factors: disease, nomadic invaders, such as the Apache, climate regime and leadership vacuum created by the Saladoans that moved away during that time. Most archaeologist suggest that the Hohokam remained in the villages and became the present day Pimas, who were living in houses in pits and were practising irrigation agriculture upon the arrival of the Spaniards.\r\n \t\r\nCasa Grande as a national monument\r\n\tIn 1877 the first pictures of Casa Grande were taken. This stimulated a local desire to preserve Casa Grande. A group of New Jersey geologists determined in April 1979 that the territorial government had to act soon to protect it. Nothing happened until 1887 when a United States Geological Survey official advised the Arizona people and legislature that Casa Grande had enough scientific and historic value that it should be protected from vandalism and natural decay.  \r\n\tIn 1878 a national focus on the Indians in the Southwest occurred with a visit to the area by Lewis Henry Morgan. He decided to let one of his students study Casa Grande. A year later the Hemenway Southwestern Archaeological expedition visited Casa Grande. Baxter, the secretary-treasurer of the expedition became very attached to Casa Grande and persuaded Mrs. Hemenway of the importance of preserving Casa Grande by creating a reservation. In February 1889 a petition was presented to Congress for creating a reservation. The petition was approved in 1889, but the president had to declare Casa Grande a reservation. This did not happen until June 22, 1892. In the mean time plans were made to preserve and restore Casa Grande. One of the plans consisted of building a roof over Casa Grande. Plans were made and construction started in 1903.\r\n\tIn 1916 the National Park Service was created. Despite this fact Casa Grande was not declared a national monument and remained under the General Land Office. But this Office tried either to deny that the bureau managed the reservation or they simply ignored it. As a result of that, starting late 1916, the General Land Office started a procedure dat would designate Casa Grande a national monument. By the end of 1917 the secretary of the interior had given the National Park Services jurisdiction over Casa Grande reservation, even though it legally still belonged to the General Land Office. In 1918 the president proclaimed Casa Grande to be a national monument.\r\n\tIn the following years plans were made and executed to further preserve the monument. Debris was removed and in 1932 a new roof was build over the monument. Beside this picnic areas and a museum were constructed for visitors. \r\n\r\nAlvin M.

One year later Francisco de Coronado would reach the Southwest of what today are the United States. He was searching for the legendary “Seven Cities of Cibola”, looking for gold that did not exist. 300 years later other explorers would reach the same regions, looking for gold and more.\r\nDuring the end of the 19th century archeological sites became more and more noted by people traveling trough the country. Soon people began to visit them.\r\nExpeditions, mostly private initiatives, consisting of scientists, writers and photographers visited the sites. In the Soutwest, for example, they became enchanted by the clifdwellings and their lost civilizations. Soon after, accounts of their adventures were publicized in newspapers and reports. The public’s attention was drawn to the different archeological areas and with the railroads expanding trough the country that same public went to visit the sites themselves.  \r\nThe legend of the “Seven Cities of Cibola” also made people go to archeological areas, and with them often came permanent settlement.  \r\nDuring the end of the century tourism was well established in the archeological areas. Unfortunately visitors started to loot the sites and concern for the different sites began to grow. Nationally and regionally people joined together to protect the sites from looting and digging.     \r\nTheir effort was not lost. In June 1906 President Teddy Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act. The sites were now protected by the government from looting and digging. The signing of the Act also caused the general public to get interested in archeology on the different sites. Public programs were started to take care of the artifacts and to study the different sites.\r\nWith the Great Depression of the 1930s archeology profited greatly from the New Deal. The purpose of the New Deal was to provide relief to a part of the population and to reform the economic system. Thousands of people were put to work on sites throughout the country. Now in stead of only artifacts whole villages and mounds were excavated. For the first time community and house plans were looked at. Large quantities of artifacts were excavated until the beginning of World War II when people were put to work in factories. The New Deal had a large impact even until far after World War II. Even today materials found during the 1930s are used in reports of investigation.   \r\n\r\nPieter Hovens: Indianen van Noord-Amerika (1977 Van Gorcum, Assen/Amsterdam) p. 52, 53\r\nDuane A.
