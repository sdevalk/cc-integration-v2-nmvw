<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7186-1> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The necklace `Worldwide Respect' was made by Sébastien Carré when he was `artist in residence' during the exhibition `Sieraden - Makers & dragers' in Museum Volkenkunde in 2018.\r\n`Worldwide Respect' was made with African turquoise, chrysocolla, unakite, ruby zoisite, garnet, human hair, seashells, mother of pearl, rudraska, salwag, coco nut & lotus seeds, leather, beads, raffia, japanese paper, cotton, silk and nylon. He started with the materials he already knew, and slowly moved towards materials he encountered in the NMvW-collections, moving through the exhibition themes: beads and nature, and through three aspects of interest: beads, mixing materials and  textile techniques such as crochet and macramé. This work would not have been made without the objects in the NMvW-collections that caught his eye.\r\nSébastien Carré on the creation process:\r\n“On one side the beads create the roots that link us all. I began a net technics that seems to be one of the most spread technics used to create a textile like object. As a guttural instinct, craftsmen seem to have realized it was the best way to create an object using mainly beads. To make this feeling more universal I used mainly red, pink and purple color to make it look more organic. The roots turn into the shape of a leaf and its color changed from red to green after an inspiring meeting with the curator for Africa of the Museum and learning the special use of these two colors in central Africa. The final shape can be seen as a symbolic shape of Africa, a leaf or a heart.\r\nThe other end of the branch is a story I wanted to express through the use of natural materials finding inspiration in their use in other culture. Each part is meaningful and is helping bringing the statement. The use of braided hair to create a weaving brought the idea of grieving (inspired by the use of human hair around the globe and by the story of the material) Mixing it with gemstones and seashells is a way to make us realized we could loose some of the natural wonders if we don’t take better care of the nature. The tree is there present through the shape of the seeds. They are suppose to act as a reminder to the wearer that even if it isn’t right in front of our eyes, our actions can have an impact in other part of the world. The sounds and movements produced by these drippings are going to make the wearer more aware of himself and so on of the other species surrounding us.\r\nTo close this “Butterfly effect” - reminder necklace, I decided to use a final technic and material I love to use. The Japanese paper with a macramé and weaving technics were going to create a new tree branch but with a more figurative style and mixing it to beads to make it look more organic. Creating a tree branch with the use of paper was for me a final act of respect by making the material look like what it is extracted from.\r\nThis necklace has no beginning and no end; it is a cycle, the one of life.\"" .
