<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-2385-24> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This rare ceremonial dance ornament represents a hornbill (haivui). It is carved from wood. It has a very long beak and wide-spread wings. The neck is covered with abrus pips and coix seeds. The round body is painted black and decorated with black pips. The black painted wings are made of pieces of sago-leaf stem, which are bound together by means of bamboo sticks. The top is largely decorated with coix seeds and abrus pips. The eyes of the bird are also indicated by abrus pips. On the bottom there is a hole to which a stick was attached by means of which the ornament was carried above the bearer's head. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \r\nAccording to the donor, children carried this object attached to a stick during the parade in honour of the marriage of Princess Juliana of the Netherlands.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \t\t\t \r\nThe bird ornament is a replica of the Uaba-rek clan emblem representing a totemic ancestor/animal, whose ritual significance and cultural symbolism are rooted in Marind mythology. The hornbill is a totem of Geb-ze phratry.  According to its myth the children have changed into these birds. The people of Dimai on the Digul, who are tree dwellers, are his descendants. \r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 28.11. 2006" .
