Identificatie had plaats aan de hand van de ingesneden, curvilineaire ornamentatieaan de zijkant.\r\n\r\nBoats were essential among Sentani people. Water was the connecting element between most of the villages, as well as between them and the sago swamps and gardens. Boats were dugout canoes which, unlike the boats used by the people in the north, had no outrigger or gunwales.\r\nTwo kinds of boats could be found, the ifa, or men’s boat and the kayi, or women’s boat. \r\nThe men's boat was a narrow, one-man craft, so narrow that the man using it did not sit in the hull but on the edge, one leg placed in front of the other.\r\nIt had no decoration because they should '' slide through the water like a sword''.\r\nWomen's boats were long, heavy dugout canoes. The larger one could carry some ten to fifteen women. They were used for fishing and for access to the gardens and sago swamps. Unlike the men's boat they had carved ornamentation applied to the platformlike prow." .
