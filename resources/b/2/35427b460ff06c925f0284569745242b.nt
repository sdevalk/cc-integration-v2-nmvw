Rechthoekig met gaten van knoesten.\r\n\r\nThe bark cloth was worn in such a way that the fibre run horizontally. \r\nWhen Sande travelled in New Guinea (1903), he noticed that the sarong replaced little by little the former dress in the western regions (in the South West coast near Arguni Bay, in the district of Kaimani, at Nagramadu, at Angadi, in Geelvinck Bay and in the east of Cape d’Urville) because of the establishment of missionaries. Yet at the same time on Lake Sentani, people wore bark cloth. (Sande, 1907, 94)\r\nThe preparation of bark cloth is done by the women of the village. Sande described what he has seen in Asei. Women brought a piece of sapling of 2 m. in length and 12-14 cm in diameter. It was cut off transversally at both ends. The stem part was removed. The top of the layer of greyish green bark was scraped off with a shell (Cyrena) obtained from Humboldt Bay. Then the tree was beaten on the outside with a short piece of wood, called fema. Women would always take care to beat in an angle of 45°. Small drops of moisture were coming out of the bark at each blow, and gradually this was beginning to lie loosely round the stem, as it became too wide for it. Near and round the knots, the connection between the wood and the bark was removed by slight blows. Constantly turning the tree over, the whole surface was thus treated. After this the spot where most knots occurred in the same longitudinal line was carefully selected for cutting the bark open lengthways, in order to obtain a minimum of holes in the middle of the piece. The bark then dropped easily off the stem (see Sande, 1907, 235, fig. 144). From the inside of the flatly outstretched bark, a thin white fleece was removed by scraping lengthwise with the shell. The bark was then beaten and it obtained a darker colour. All the time, one or more large flat round stones, gabbro, were lying under the spots where the beating occurred. As long as the bark was still hard, it was extended. After it had become more pliable under the beating, the material was folded to continue the beating without breaking the fibres (see Sande, 1907, 235, fig. 145 and 146) The bark then becomes thinner, broader and a little shorter, but also looser. The bark was placed for a longer or a shorter period in the water, wrung hard by two women, standing opposite each other, holding it lengthwise. Finally it was hung to dry  in the sun outside the house (see Sande, 1907, 235, fig. 147)\r\nSande underlines that not much attention was paid to the nature of the beater. In Asei, pieces of wood are used and the woman photographed by Sande used the broad back of her chopper." .
