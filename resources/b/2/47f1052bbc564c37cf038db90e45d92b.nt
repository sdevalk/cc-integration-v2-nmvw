M. Hocart during the latter's ethnographic fieldwork In October 1908. They illustrate a series of narratives, Mostly concerning mythical events associated with the gods (tamasa) but also descibing recent history. Although some sequencing occurs, the\r\nimages interweave several tales across each page, and their meaning is not always clear. The drawing featuring a shrine in the upper right (cat. 38) presents an origin myth, the tale of Heleveni and Veonona, two tamasa who lived on the island of Kolombangara, shown in profile below Simbo at the top of the page. Veonona made people, but Heleveni made the islands, gave people different languages, and created death. Heleveni sent a dog to the neighbouring island or Isabel to procure baskets of witchcraft, but the dog lost these after his canoe sank - eight baskets floated to Simbo, and one to Kolombangara. The witchcralt killed a chief, and so Heleveni built a skull shrine in a new way (top right). Different from Veonona''s earlier efforts, which only enshrined fern fronds. Ultimately Veonona and his people resolved to leave Kolombangara, which they did in two war canoes (tomoko) named Manoga Lima. travelling to Tauloho in the Manning Strait; near there the tomoko turned into narrow parallel islands. Veonona then departed for Isabel, leaving behind his sister's son Hirikatekatei, who became a reef. The narrative was said to establish that Roviana people had rights to islands in the Manning Straits, in opposition to the use of that land by European planters. Other drawings document ownership of ritual knowledge and lore. A shark tamasa, Kolodavi, is called upon to save a sinking trade canoe (cal. 36); a man named Pala Reka calls upon his tamasa charms to raise a reef or sand during a storm at sea, rescuing a fleet or tomoko (2010.455; not exhibited). The top of this work illustrates the fate of a party of men who visited Simbo and wrongly ate nuts from a tree protected by a tamasa. One who reproached the others was given a protection charm by the chief, but as the party departed, the seas rose up and their canoes were battered by flying fish. The men dropped eight charms to quell the waters, but their canoes\r\nsank. They swam to a sandbank, and all but the man who had reproached the others were devoured by sharks as they crossed a final\r\npassage. The events were said to be historical, but they provide a morality tale that demonstrates the efficacy of the property taboe over the nut grove. and indeed acknowlertge, lhat nuts were a specialist trade product of Simbo.\r\n\r\n(Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts, p.286)" .
