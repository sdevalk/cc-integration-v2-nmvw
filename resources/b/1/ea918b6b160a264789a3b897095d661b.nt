<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/5d3e879ab8b092b599fa9a79c70212bb> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This wooden figure probably represents an ancestor or relative that recently died. It is carved from one piece of wood. Like all carving work, this was a man's job. \r\nIt shows a male person with big legs and feet and it is standing on the mouth of a crocodile. The man wears some strings as a belt around his hip and is adorned with plaits around his legs and arms. There is a v-shaped carving on the chest. The figure has a hat on his head, from where the hair is sticking out. The whole figure is coloured red with white and black colours carvings.\r\nThe meaning of these figures is not quite clear apart from that they were always set up in men's houses. One can therefore assume that they represent deceased relatives or clan members. It is set up as a memory of the deceased rather than a resting place for its soul. The crocodile is probably referring to the clan's totem." .
