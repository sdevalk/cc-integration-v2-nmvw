A fibre cord is knotted to the rim to hang it up. The hollowed out and smoothed coconut is parted in half (not necessarily evenly). The manufacture was the work of the men, as is almost all carving  and wood work.\r\nThe ladle was used to scoop liquids and solid food from pots and kettles or even as a drinking vessel." .
