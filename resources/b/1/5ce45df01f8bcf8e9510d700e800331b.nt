<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-362-78> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "362-78\r\nYuma war club; keeleeahgwai (TK); ke'lyaxwai (Spier 1931:170); Mohave: kalya'hwai (Spier 1955:10); Cocopa: shyawhai (Gifford 1933:274); ironwood, pigments; l. 27.4 cm., w. at top end 9.5 cm.; ca. 1870-1880.\r\n\tThis war club, made from ironwood (Olneya tesota), is of the mallet or \"potato-masher\" type, and decorated with painted designs, notably representing people and hands. The black dots are applied with black manganese dioxide; the red hematite hands are possibly a protective motif. The design on the flat top consists of five arms with hands in a whirlwind pattern, probably indicating manual dexterity of warriors fighting with these clubs.\r\n\tThese weapons for close combat were often carved from a single piece of hard wood, either ironwood or mesquite. Those of ironwood, such as the Leiden specimen, were somewhat smaller than those of mesquite because of their heavier weight. The head is cylindrical and has sharp edges to deliver cutting blows to an enemy in hand-to-hand combat. The end of the handle was sharpened to function as a dagger. Sometimes a separate sharp butt was carved or glued to the club, such as in this case. A leather thong through the handle provided easy carrying and prevented loss of the weapon in the heat of battle. The necessary accompaniment to the war club was the stiff leather circular shield with which the warriors fended off blows from their opponents.\r\nIn the world view of the Quechans, warfare was a requirement for insuring and spiritual wellbeing and material blessing, and thus had a strong mystical connotation. However, a war complex never developed and their war chiefs (kwanami, brave men) generally led short, intermittent and small-scale raids and attacks. Arranged pitched battles took place with traditional enemies such as the Maricopas and were accompanied by rituals, demonstrations of courage by warriors carrying feathered staves, and the taking of scalps. Between 1690 and 1848 slave raiding took place to some extent, Indian captives being sold to Spanish households in Sonora  (cf. Forde 1931:134-139,160-170; Spier 1933:131-137; 1936:18; 1955:9-10, fig. 2c; Gifford 1933:274; Forbes 1965:70-82,251-256,286-293; Bee 1983:93; Trippel 1984:180-181, fig. 4; Bolz and Sanner 1999:106, fig. 85; see also: Piman clubs and shield: RMV 362-36, 45, 46, 764-61).\r\nIn the Leiden museum's documentation this was club was also at some time listed as Diegueño, but the source of this attribution is a mystery. However, Spier (1923:354) noted that the Diegueños only used curved and hooked war clubs, although they knew about the potato-masher war clubs of the neighboring Yumas and Cocopas.\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)" .
