Korean men fastened it at shoes to make trouser legs narrow. When they wore trousers or short pants it made walking and action easier. Most Korean men wore them without class distinction. In Koryŏ, men fastened leggings on top of trouser legs. In Chosŏn, sleeves with two ropes made out of hemp were put in each leg, and the ropes were then tied.\r\nThe common people wore them when they went out or worked. The low-class people were not allowed to wear haengjŏn, but used to fasten the leg part of their trouser with cloth belts.The Buddhist priests wear black haengjŏn." .
