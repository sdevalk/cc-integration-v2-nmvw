<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/3f5aaa970503533fbeaec042878d9095> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This wooden figure is the largest carved human representation in the collection. It has a long body with big belly and two legs on the sides. The legs are not very realistic as they look more like two standing poles and are rather flat than round. They don't have feet on them and the wood is damaged.\r\nThe figure has quite a big head with an exaggerated long chin which has an arrow-head tip. Two small arms are holding the chin, although one arm is broken off. There is no remark about this on the museum card, so it is not sure when it happened or where the arm is. \r\nOn the head, the figure wears a hat. The face has a small nose, small eyes and ears, but all are clearly visible. The figure is coloured red, the face and a belt around the hip are black. \r\n\r\nThe carving of such figures was a man's job. \r\nIt is not entirely sure what the function of this figure was. It is probably not a door post, as the feet don't look stable enough to hold a door beam. Human figures were furthermore seldom used as motifs for door posts. \r\nThere is a possibility for it to be an ancestral figure which perhaps was sat on a beam in a men's house. The design of this figure is different from all the others in the collection, which makes it harder to identify its purpose." .
