Kooijman, info afkomstig van Miss M. Bundock, 1892)\r\n\r\nSchild uit één stuk hout gemaakt, met aan de achterzijde een handvat ontstaan door uitsnijding binnen het eigenlijke schild. De achterzijde is onversierd. De voorzijde is voorzien van een patroon in rood, wit (en zwart?). Zie aangehechte foto. De inheemse naam van het schild is op de oude beschrijvingskaart aangegeven als puchah. Is mogelijk gelijk te stellen aan puka, de inheemse naam van een boomsoort (meryta sinclairii).\r\n\r\nOval shield plano-convex in cross section with painted decoration in red, black, and white on the convex upper surface (see fig. 10). This back is unpainted. The shield is made of light-weight, light-coloured wood, and the handle is cut into the solid wood of the back, with a hand-hole measuring 10.5 x 8.0 x 4.6 cm. The handle itself measures 8.0 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm. A note on the artefact identifies the wood used as Meryta sinclairii, and in her letter of 28 October 1892 Miss Bundock gives the native name as 'Puchah'.\r\n\r\nShields: The oval shield, plano-convex in cross-section, with the handle cut form the solid wood of the body of the shield itself, and made of very light-weight wood, the upper surface often painted, seems to be a shield type characteristic of the north coast of New South Wales, from the Macleay to the Richmond and Tweed Rivers. It is quite distinct from the oval shield of U-shaped section with the handle made from a separate lenght of vine or supple wood inserted through two holes cut into the body of the shield. This type of shield is recorded for the New South Wales coast from Port Macquarie south to Port Jackson (see Dick 1915).\r\n\r\nThe examples donated to the Leiden museum by Miss Bundock are said by the donor to be made from the wood of the Meryta sinclairii, also light-weght and soft, so probably very similar to that of the tree traditionally chosen to provide the wood for shields. The requirements here are a wood which is serviceable and tough, but also light to carry and use in combat. These examplesmust have been made in the years following settlement in the Richmond, as the tree is an import, the New Zealand Pukani. A small tree, not at all frost tolerant, so well suited to the mid winters of the Richmond valley, it was grown as a garden plant prized for its decorative leaves (Anderson 1968:301).\r\n\r\nThe shields compare with those of south-east Queensland in construction, but differ grom those of the coastal river valleys to the south. The region of the Tweed, Richmond, and Clarence Rivers would seem, in terms of material culture, to from a distinct unit.\r\n\r\nThe distinctness of the area is seen again in the plain clubs and the decoration of the painted wooden shields. The finely incised geometric and linear patterns characteristic of the shields, clubs, an boomerangs, of werstern and central areas of New South Wales are not found. Unfortunately our collection of shields (the only highly decorated item) is insufficient to allow detailed analysis of the design elements in the decoration. Black, white and red are the only colours used. They are also the colours used for the drawings in rock shelter sites in the Richmond region. Yellow pigments were either unavailable or not favoured. However there seems to be no stylistic link between the motifs of the rock art and the designs used to decorate the shields." .
