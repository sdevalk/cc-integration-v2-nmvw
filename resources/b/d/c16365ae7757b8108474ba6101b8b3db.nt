Wati paluru Ngankari (a male healer, traditional doctor). He is a powerful man. When rain comes he hides in his nest. He is a clever man. At night time he changes colour. His name is Wanka, spider. That's the story. Minyma wanka tjuta, these are all the women and children for this man, ngankari (healer, traditional doctor).\r\n\r\nThat minyma ninu (bilby woman) and her family were eating all the maku (witchetty grubs). There are a lot of different maku, tjilka-tjilka, punti, ngarkalya and kanturangu. She ate so much that there were only ngigirpa left (little immature ones). The wati mututa (ant men) got really angry and they chased the bilby family, husband, wife and kids and speared them. They came marching together." .
