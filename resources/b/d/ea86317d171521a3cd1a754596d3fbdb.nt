<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-2802-94a> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This wooden ornament is- according to the description on the museum card- a platform which was attached to the centre of a dancing beam. \r\nIt is a longish oval which is subdivided into three sections by wooden bars. The ends are round and enclose a spiral each. The middle bar has a hole through which a piece of wood could be put to fix it to the dancing beam. It is coloured red and has carved patterns all over which are coloured white and black. It strongly reminds of a canoe prow, which often had similar adornments. The carving was the men's job. \r\nThis ornament was probably attached in a right angle to the dancing beam. A man would dance on the round end parts, which stuck out. The movement would cause the ends of the beam to start swinging. There is not much reference to this kind of platform found in the literature, so no certain statements can be made.  \r\nThe dancing beam was a long beam of wood (up to 10 metres long) which was laid on two or three posts in front of the men's house. It was decorated with carvings along the sides and had adorned ends, often in the shape of a crocodile's mouth. The leading men of a clan would dance on the beam during dancing ceremonies. It is not known, what the meaning of the beam or the act of dancing on the beam was. As it was quite dangerous to dance on the beam due to its thin surface (around 10 cm), it was considered prestigious and challenging. \r\nThe beam also used to be part of remembrance ceremonies, where the skulls of deceased persons would be tied to it. \r\n\r\nItems 2802-94b and c belong together with this object." .
