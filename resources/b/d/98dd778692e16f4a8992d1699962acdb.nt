<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7106-725> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This painting depicts designs associated with Tingari ceremonies at Wilkinkarra (Lake Mackay). In ancestral times a large group of Tingari men came to this site carrying the Fire Dreaming. Once the fire was lit at Wilkinkarra it quickly became out of control and chased the men west towards Kiwirrkura. Wilkinkarra is also associated with Larularunya, a species of snake who had travelled from Mt Wedge to the lake, where it escaped the fire by travelling underground to Nyinmi. This snake was assisted in his escape by clouds of water which dampened the full force of the fire. Since events associated with the Tingari Cycle are of a secret nature no further detail was given. Generally, the Tingari are a group of ancestral beings of the Dreaming who travelled over vast stretches of the country, performing rituals and creating and shaping particular sites. The Tingari men were usually followed by Tingari women and were accompanied by novices, and their travels and adventures are enshrined in a number of song cycles. These ancestral stories form part of the teachings of the post initiatory youths today as well as providing explanations for contemporary customs." .
