On both sides of the notch, there are four tiny holes into which fibre strings with red, white and blue beads are put. The two strings closest to the centre furthermore have dried leaves at their ends. These leaves would hang down and almost cover the mouth. The whole stick has fine carvings all over which are coloured black. It shows symmetrical patterns with triangles. \r\nBoth men and women have a penetrated nasal septum from quite early onwards, but only seldom do they wear nose adornments." .
