<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/0593a11dee94b7be86754ae035debde4> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This nose ornament (nyeling) was collected in 2002 in Apangai, an Abelam village in Papua New-Guinea. It had two names “Nyelap” and “Galawate” and was known for its ‘brilliance’. It completes the RV-6000-* series which was also collected by Noel McGuigan in 2002.\r\n\r\nThe nyeling consist of a ‘stick’ cut from shell.\r\n\r\nTraditionally nyeling are made from straight lengths of the giant clam shell tridacna. These were cut from the `detritus tridacna’ left after a shell ring had been cut from a blank of shell. They were used as decorative jewellery and were worn through the pierced septum by men who had seen Puti.\r\n\r\nThe majority of nyeling were short in length, perhaps five, six or seven centimetres long. Long examples, such as this one, are rare, perhaps because they are brittle and given to snap easily. The collector (Noel McGuigan) acquired several nyeling during his time with the Abelam but none of them came anywhere close in length to this one. Long specimens, particularly those used by ancestors (even those of relatively recently deceased), although used decoratively, were also ritually important. They were imbued with magical spiritual power with the sanction of the ancestors. The ritual use to which they were put included being inserted in the septum of a Puti figure at initiation (Puti maira), or similarly inserted in a baba in a yam shrine display, or again, put through the nose of an urangwal (see below). \r\n\r\nOnly the most senior of (Abelam) males were entitled to use these decorative elements. Noel McGuigan can’t recall ever seeing anyone wear one: they had become a decorative feature that had lost their significance by the early seventies when he first encountered Abelam. However, he has seen photographs of younger men and youths wearing imitation nyeling for Bangu (ceremonial dance) following initiation ceremonies. Two of the pieces he collected for Museum Volkenkunde in 2002 have short lengths of timber, symbolising nyeling, through the ‘noses’ of the objects, one a urangwai RV-6000-48, the other a tewut RV-6000-112.\r\n\r\nThis nyeling was acquired long after their ritual importance had declined, when most of the nimandu (bigmen) who adhered to traditional beliefs were either dead or in terminal decline and when traditional Abelam beliefs had been undermined by the forces of modernity. At the time of purchase this nyeling was used by a man in his thirties as a lime stick. It was described to McGuigan as simian wala nyeling – a long white nyeling (wala is an Abelam word for a primordial spirit. It is also used to describe something that is long, as used here). Although he had been tempted to clean it to re-emphasis its `brilliance’, he refrained from doing so. \r\n\r\nAlong with two circular glass rings of German origin wanta (ear rings) RV-6000-80, this nyeling was formerly owned by Koingwimba, an important yam grower, of Yamuk hamlet, Apangai village.\r\n(Information provided by Noel McGuigan, 2022)" .
