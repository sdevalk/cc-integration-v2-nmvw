They are only roughly formed in that manner, the finished shape, the sharp point, and the fine serrations on the edge of the spear-head, are produced by strongly pressing the flint or glass against the edge of a broken Kangaroo-bone, and by thus continually nicking of little chips or flakes, the spear-head is gradually formed (Taf. III. Fig. 15 & 20).\r\n\r\nThe empty beer- and whisky-bottles, discared by the white population in the small settlements of Roebourne und Cossack, are eagerly picked up by the Aborigines, and traded into the interior, where they are highly prized, especially by the \"Myal\" and \"Balgu\"-tribe of the desert." .
