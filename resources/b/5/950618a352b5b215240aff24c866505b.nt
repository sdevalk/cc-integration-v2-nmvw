This is a modern name given by the natives, on account of the labyrinth of passages and appartments that occur beneath the towers. This temple is so much shrouded with forest trees, climbing vines, and thorny brushwood, that it was only after hard day's cutting, with a party of natives, that we succeeded in clearing the tower sufficiently to obtain a photograph. This edifice, like Nakhon Wat, occupies nearly a square, measuring from 400 to 500 feet each way. It, too, has an outer corridor (the roof of which has fallen in). The back walls, like Nakhon Wat, are also adorned with bas-relief representations of battle scenes, &c. On one of these we found represented a huge engine of war in the form of a cross-bow, mounted on a wheeled vehicle resembling our modern gun carriage, and drawn by men. This subject occurs on the left of the south gateway of the temple. Our efforts to produce a plan of the building proved abortive, as we had not sufficient men to make the necessary clearings, and we would  have been exposed at every step to the danger of being crushed by falling masses of stone, as some of the blocks seemed to depend for their position upon the vines that were coiled, like a multitude of cables, around them. The building, as nearly as  we could ascertain, has one great central tower, with fifty minor ones, corresponding to that shewn in the photograph, grouped around it. Each tower is surmounted with the four-faced Phrohm (Brahma). The passages beneath, in the lower storey of the   temple, are so numerous and intricate that we frequently found difficulty in extricating ourselves from the labyrinth, while their dark, damp, interiors were suggestive of the scene of a nightmare. As we advanced, rifle in hand, every step brought down flights of shrieking bats that flapped their clammy wings against our faces.\r\n\r\nin: Album \"The antiquities of Cambodia a series of photographs taken on the spot With Letterpress Description By John Thomson, F.R.G.S., F.E.S.L., Edinburgh: Edmonston & Douglas MDCCCLXVII\"; opgenomen in KIT Library ILS (RF-279) page 67." .
