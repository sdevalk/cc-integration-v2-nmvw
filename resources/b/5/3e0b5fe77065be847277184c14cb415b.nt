The coconut is freed from the outer shell with the hair. Then it is smoothed with a knife and polished with a file. This was done by men. The natural texture of the coconut can still be seen. \r\nThe coconuts served as storing and transportation vessel for water. Several of them were tied into bundles and carried on a carrying stick. A small piece of wood or coral, which is longer than the opening of the nut is tied at the end of a twisted fibre cord. All the cords are then tied together. \r\nIf needed, the opening would be closed with a ball of fibre or a piece of wood." .
