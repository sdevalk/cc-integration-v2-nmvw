<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7240-17> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Painting by Shen Xiaobo 沈曉柏 of a famous scene from the Shiwuguan 十五貫 (fifteen strings of cash) when Kuang Zhong 況鐘 disguised as fortune teller questions the rat. Shiwuguan was originally written in the seventeenth century, but the script was adapted in the 1950s and performed by Kunqu masters and became a huge success. Thereafter it became known as the play that revived the whole theatre genre of kunqu opera. Shen Xiaobo is the father of a good friend of Laurent Long’s and gave him this painting because Long has translated the 十五貫 (fifteen strings of cash)." .
