She was one of the exceptional potters of her generation, her skill not deteriorating with either age or illness. Elva always used the Sikyatki revival designs made famous by Nampeyo. Elva’s siblings were potters as are most of her children. The Nampeyo legacy is particularly present and can be understood by a potter such as Elva Nampeyo.\r\n\r\nIt might be said that she was not a particularly “inventive” potter or her pots were not in the same elite classification of her mother or grandmother’s work. Rather she was a quality potter; someone who worked consistently and diligently at her craft. She followed the traditions and techniques of pottery as she learned them by sitting at her famous relatives’ side and probably received the gentle nudging and reminding of how to mix, form, and paint. The generational consistently is quite astonishing – and at once deceiving. Elva did indeed work within a constricted style made famous by her grandmother. The art market and associated curators, collectors and dealers further restrained the market by imposing a hermetic matrilineality on Elva and others like her. For her there quickly rose an expectation that somehow Hopi-Tewa pottery was biologically passed generation to generation rather than a more accurate understanding that the challenges of making pottery are not born into people but are learned. This longing and mis-placed Social Darwinist cultural longing has no place in the discussion of Pueblo pottery. Yet, it has dominated discussions and can derail us from understanding Pueblo pottery, potters, and their motivations.\r\n\r\nElva like so many Pueblo potters worked continuously and meticulously on her pottery, along, not unimportantly, with raising her family and fulfilling her community obligations. Elva’s pottery was cultural first and for the art market a distant second. As a Hopi-Tewa her way of life, her responsibilities to participate and support communal life guided her and her family’s lives. The pottery she made was principally made to sell to non-Native people to be placed in exhibition cases and on shelves. Not unimportantly, pottery provided a vital source of income for her and her family. But even considering these factors pottery still has a more important, a higher purpose, if you will. Pottery is life. As life, pottery making reinforces, reminds, and produces new and continuing life. The life we are talking about are the foundational stones of Hopi-Tewa culture, the essence of who people are and how they make sense of themselves within their own Hopi and Native worlds as well as the broader worlds that now surround them. Pottery is living testimony; they are living beings telling the world that the Hopi-Tewa are and how they came to be, and how they continue.\r\n\r\nFamily and lineage are important, vital to understanding Elva’s community past, present, and future. As outsiders, however, we have mythologized family as a tree of expectation and an automatic biological transmittance of talent from one generation to the next. Elva indeed inherited the talent of her mother and grandmother. The inheritance however is the act of making pottery rather than a qualitative distinction. Elva as a steady but not extraordinary potter is vital to her family and community. Without veteran experience of pottery making there would be no place from which genius to excel and grow. Like most potters then, Elva is foundation, firm and still in a world that swirls around the Hopi-Tewa calling every day for change.\r\n\r\nNot one word written here detracts from Elva’s pottery, but rather is intended to grow and elevate our appreciation of the fit of pottery in the Native rather than non-Native world. The shouldered bowl she made follows important conventions of her generation of potters. She collected and prepared the clays and paints. She hand-built the pot without the benefit of a potters wheel or mold. She probably marked the pottery into quadrants before beginning to paint freehand the design most commonly known in English as “migration.” Herein is the key. Migration is the continuing story of Elva’s family and people; each day is continuation of the Hopi-Tewa origin migration. The act of making pottery continues the creation story and should be considered neither reaction nor reenactment. Her pot then – her life, sits well within the continuity and persistence of Hopi-Tewa life forever firm and forthright in its voice.\r\n\r\nBruce Bernstein; Coe Foundation for the Arts\r\nSanta Fe, NM; 2015\r\n \r\nAardewerk in Sikyatki Revival stijl, beschilderd met vruchtbaarheidssymbolen. Deze naam is afgeleid van het laat-prehistorisch aardewerk Sikyatki Polychrome (1375-1625) wat door de voorouders van de Hopi werd gemaakt. Tijdens het laatste decennium van de 19e eeuw lieten Hopi en Hopi-Tewa vrouwen van First Mesa zich inspireren door de vormen en decoraties van dit oude aardewerk. Dat werd mede verorzaakt doordat handelaar Thomas Keam daarvoor een markt zag en de archeoloog Jesse Walter Fewkes de nederzetting Sikyatki blootlegde en er veel aardewerk aan het licht kwam dat de pottenbaksters zagen. Nampeyo (Hopi-Tewa) nam daarin de leiding maar werd spoedig gevolgd door andere vrouwen toen het ceramiek goed werd verkocht. Zij was echter de meest kundige en demonstreerde haar vaardigheden aan bezoekers van de Grand Canyon en tijdens grote beurzen in de grote steden.\r\n\r\nSikyatki Revival stijl aardewerk is overwegend polychroom, rood of geel-wit. De decoratie bestaat overwegend uit figuren met ronde en golvende lijnen, passend bij de smaak uit de Art Nouveau periode. Veel voorkomende figuren zijn veren, regenwolken en kachinas, alle geassocieerd met vruchtbaarheid. Een innovatie was de vaas-vorm, vaak als tulpenvaas aangeduid.\r\n\r\nVanaf 1920 ging de kwaliteit van het Hopi-aardewerk snel achteruit door de nadruk op massaproductie. De School of American Research (Santa Fe) en het Museum of Northern Arizona (Flagstaff) hebben een belangrijke rol gespeeld in het op een nieuw kwalitatief niveau brengen van het Hopi aardewerk door hun aankoopbeleid, het uitgeven van een kwaliteitskeurmerk en het organiseren van gepremieerde wedstrijden voor pottenbaksters." .
