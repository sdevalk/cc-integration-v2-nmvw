Schmeltz 1903; beschrijvingskaart)\r\n\r\nKaili, boomerang like No. 1321-43, but more curved and less carefully done.\r\n\r\nThe boys are painted all over with \"wilgie\" or red-ochre, and are then fed by the old women with various grass-seeds, pounded and ground to a pulp on the \"mijarra\", [see No. 1207-96] and moistened with water (baba), or baked in little cakes in the hot ashes. Meat is not allowed them on this occasion.\r\n\r\nAt night, huge fires are kindled, and the elders sit around them with the candidates, teaching them the laws and traditions of the tribes, the boundaries of their territory, the reasons of their feuds with other tribes etc., etc., and the strict lines of their future conduct are clearly laid down for them.\r\n\r\nRitual songs and dances are taught and performed, their significance explained and the mystery of the \"tarlow\"and its ceremonial expounded.\r\n\r\nThe \"una\" or hunting dance of the men, and the dance of the old women, the \"tubagéh\", are danced every night around the camp-fire, accompanied by the rattling of spears and kailis [see No's: 1207-46], and the incessant roaring of the boonangharries [see No's 1207-14, and 1321-48] and the monotonous songs of the old men.\r\n\r\nThe \"nambéh\", or circumcision-song is taught to them, so that they may sing it on the day of the actual ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe \"una\"dance is one of the most weird spectacles imaginable.\r\nSome 30 or 40 men (more in larger tribes), feather ornaments on head and upper arms, a wurrindi, or bunch of Emu-feathers [see No's: 1321-18 and 1321-19], coloured with wilgie hanging behind, from a hair-belt tied around the waist, a muljeddie of wood [see No's: 1207-73 and 1207-96] or Kangaroo-bone [see No. 1321-27], trough the septum of the nose, and painted with white and red stripes across the face, chest, abdomen and thighs, suddenly spring with a yell from the outer darkness into the bright fire circle.\r\n\r\nA short strong spear (about 6 feet long) in each hand, held perpendicularly, the shaft touching the ground, the body bent forward, eyes rolling and teeth glistening, they stamp with feet and spear shafts on the ground, keeping time to the songs of the old men, who click their kailis [see No: 1207-46] together and rattle their mihras [see No's: 1207-7, 1207-9 and 1321-66].\r\n\r\nOld men have generally the most, and youngest wives. Exchange of wives for one or two nights frequently takes place and on such occasion a Corrobboree is held, whilst very lewd songs are sung accompanied by the clacking together of kailis (Boomerangs) [see No's: 1207-46] and the rubbing up and down of a Kangaroo-bone (cudgi or kulgujeri) [see No. 1321-16] on the incisions on the edge of the mihra or throwing-stick [see No.1321-66]." .
