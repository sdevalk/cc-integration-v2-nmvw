De basis is met hars omwoeld.\r\n\r\nSpear-head of white flint, with reddish dots; in the shape of an isosceles triangle, with serrated edges and with spinifex-gum at butt.\r\n\r\nThe making of spear-heads of flint or glass by the Australian Aborigines is not altogether done by striking the material with a stone (Taf. III. Fig. 18). They are only roughly formed in that manner, the finished shape, the sharp point, and the fine serrations on the edge of the spear-head, are produced by strongly pressing the flint or glass against the edge of a broken Kangaroo-bone, and by thus continually nicking of little chips or flakes, the spear-head is gradually formed (Taf. III. Fig. 15 & 20)." .
