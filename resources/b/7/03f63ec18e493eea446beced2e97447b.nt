This canoe could be sailed by means of the large mat sail called Tombala. The Gupapuyngu who used only bark canoes before the arrival of the Maccassans were quick to adopt the use of the Lippa Lippa and soon became skilful in making them. These sailing canoes are in use today in the Gulf and along the North Coast.\r\n\r\nAboriginal theology may be briefly described as \"ceremonial reenactment of past events.\" Therefore such important events as the introduction of the lippa lippa had to have its ceremonial dances and songs and as an adjunct to this an artifact to be used in the ceremony had to be created, hence the carved and decorated miniature canoe." .
