<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-253-51> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Hardwood parrying shield with engraved surface, separated into two halves, with a mid-section of diagonally carved incisions. Each half has a background of incisions, overlain by two linked chevron shapes, comprising figures which may be considered anthropomorphic (more obviously anthropomorphic figures have been observed on similar shields). It appears that the outline of these figures, and the transverse bands which provide top and bottom borders to these figures, were once highlighted in red ochre. A number '131', applied in red paint, appears on one of these transverse bands. Handle is carved from round.\r\nIt is worth noting that the relatively undecorated central section of the shield corresponds to an area often covered by a wrapping of possum fur or skin, as illustrated in fig.130 of R. Brough Smyth (1878, p.332) and  Plate 2, fig.7 of Spencer 1922. Shield is from the Murray River region of south-eastern Australia." .
