<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/8cea47714a80bd0d6cd9cb5f16682419> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The helve is carved of wood and polished. It has the form of a knee, which is typical of the adzed and axes of the region. The lower handle is decorated with carvings, which are coloured with white lime. It might represent a reptile or squatting figure.\r\nThe wood of the axe is coloured red. The handle has strings with white beads for further decoration attached to it. It is unfinished, as the blade, which is tied to the short side, is not yet attached. \r\nThe axe is primarily used for wood processing and therefore used primarily by men.\r\nAn axe can also have a ceremonial function, when it belongs to a certain kin group, where one official holds it and passes it to his successor. The adze is kept in the roof of the men hut and is placed visibly at the entrance on festive occasions. When goods are exchanged, the official points to the goods with the adze. \r\nThe adze is also a symbol of justice, peace and harmony and is therefore present during reconciliatory meetings." .
