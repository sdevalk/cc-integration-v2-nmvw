<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-674-61> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "362-45; 674-61\r\nPima warclubs; sónjik or sóntjik (TK), shonchki (Saxton et.al. 1983); 362-45: wood; l. 42.5 cm., w. 8.3 cm.; 674-61: wood, pigment; l. 40.5 cm., w. 6.5 cm.; ca. 1870-1880.\r\n\tThese clubs were usually made of the heaviest wood available, mesquite or ironwood (Olneya tesota). Although carved in one piece, they consisted of two parts, a short thick slightly tapering stick and a wider cylindrical head. Because of their shape these war clubs have been labeled as of the \"potato masher\" type or compared to mallets. Sometimes the end of the handle was slightly carved in a way to increase the grip of the hand. The handles sometimes have a hole through which a leather thong is drawn that could be tied around the wrist to prevent loss in battle. In many cases the handles tapered in such a way that their end was almost pointed, and in reverse fashion the club could thus serve as a dagger in close combat. Such clubs vary in length from about 38 to 46 centimeters. RMV 362-45 is painted black on the top end, and the surface of the stick is polished or waxed. This club is among the oldest Pima clubs extant in a museum collection (Russell 1908:96; Di Peso 1956:488-490; see also: 362-46).\r\n(Hovens 2009)" .
