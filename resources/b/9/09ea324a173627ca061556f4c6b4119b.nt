<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/b469e934fff2deb83e5ff2d04f19dade> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "For most of the twentieth century, spittoons were commonly used in both domestic and public places in China for spitting into. Their use was promoted as an alternative for spitting onto the floor for public health reasons and by the Republican period (1912-1949) spittoons were considered indispensable attributes of a hygienic modernity.  They were also used as rubbish bins or chamberpots, as old Chinese houses did not always have plumbing. Spittoons are no longer used in contemporary urban households, but can still be seen in the countryside. The most common type of spittoons seen in China are made of enamelled metal. Although they are inexpensive, they have cheerful decorations which make them attractive to display. \r\n\r\nHannah Li, April 2019" .
