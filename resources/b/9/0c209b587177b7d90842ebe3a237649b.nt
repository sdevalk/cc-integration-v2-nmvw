The flag is a mass-produced religious commodity that is sold in Bazars to various religious collectives, mosques and other institutions that organize rituals and ceremonies. This flag is specially designed for Muharram ceremonies of Shia communities who mourn and lament the martyrdom of Imam Husayn who was killed in the battle of Karbala (10th October 680 AD). The flag is not a procession flag but a decorative flag installed on the walls of the hall where the ceremony is held. Often, the flag is installed on both sides of a pulpit that clergy sits upon and offers his sermon.\r\n\r\nThe calligram of a lion is a symbol of Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad,  as he is called the 'Lion of God'." .
