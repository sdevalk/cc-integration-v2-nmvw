One end pierced. Ingibandi-tribe.\r\n\r\nEvery illness is ascribed to the djuno 2), or Evil-spirit, also know by the names of warruga or warrunga.\r\n\r\nWhen a member of the tribe falls ill, the boonangharries [see No's: 1207-14, 1321-48 en 1321-50] are set in motion 3), and the taketa  dressed up in feather ornaments [see No. 1321-19] and painted with white and red stripes, walks and struts round the sick person in huge circles, which get smaller and smaller until he is close to the prostrate patient, when he suddenly pounces upon him, rubbing vigorously the affected part with his hands, or a cowry-shell, Cypraea Scottii, [see No.1207-59].\r\n\r\nThen putting his mouth on the seat of pain, he pretends to pull out with his teeth the cause of the illness, generally one or two semitransparent pebbles, the size of a pidgeon's or hen's egg. which be carefully carries from the camp and buries in the sand.\r\n\r\nShould a native die, the relatives show their grief by striking their heads with flint stones and mihras [see No's: 1207-7,1207-9 and 1321-66), until the blood flows freely. They prostrate themselves upon the body screaming and howling, then walking a few yards throw themselves again and again upon the ground, giving vent to their feelings by groans and shrieks. The boonangharrie's [see No's: 1207-14, 1207-16, and 1321-48] are swung to drive the djuno away, as he is the cause of death. They do not believe in death by natural causes.\r\n\r\nIn a month's time, (the next new-moon) the whole tribe has assembled, and on a given signal by one of the elders, the candidates for circumcision are suddenly pounced upon by the men, their arms are tied firmly to the body by human hair strings, whilst the \"boonangharries\" of \"Devil-scarers\" [see No's: 1207-14, 1207-16 and 1321-48] are violently swung in the camp, to keep the \"djuno\", or Evil-spirit away.\r\n\r\nThe boys are painted all over with \"wilgie\" or red-ochre, and are then fed by the old women with various grass-seeds, pounded and ground to a pulp on the \"mijarra\", [see No. 1207-96] and moistened with water (baba), or baked in little cakes in the hot ashes. Meat is not allowed them on this occasion.\r\n\r\nAt night, huge fires are kindled, and the elders sit around them with the candidates, teaching them the laws and traditions of the tribes, the boundaries of their territory, the reasons of their feuds with other tribes etc., etc., and the strict lines of their future conduct are clearly laid down for them.\r\n\r\nRitual songs and dances are taught and performed, their significance explained and the mystery of the \"tarlow\"and its ceremonial expounded.\r\n\r\nThe \"una\" or hunting dance of the men, and the dance of the old women, the \"tubagéh\", are danced every night around the camp-fire, accompanied by the rattling of spears and kailis [see No's: 1207-46 and 1321-44], and the incessant roaring of the boonangharries [see No's 1207-14, and 1321-48] and the monotonous songs of the old men.\r\n\r\nThe \"nambéh\", or circumcision-song is taught to them, so that they may sing it on the day of the actual ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe boys are painted all over with \"wilgie\" or red-ochre, and are then fed by the old women with various grass-seeds, pounded and ground to a pulp on the \"mijarra\", [see No. 1207-96] and moistened with water (baba), or baked in little cakes in the hot ashes.
