De grootste band zou gezien de afmetingen geschikt zijn om rond de enkel geplaatst te worden. De andere lijkt hiervoor te klein en zou een polsband kunnen zijn. Dat beide boeien tegelijk voor één slaaf gebruikt zijn lijkt niet aannemelijk, tenzij deze in een hurkende of zittende positie was. Het boeien van slaven gebeurde vooral tijdens slaventransporten. Alle mannelijke slaven werden, zodra ze aan boord van een schip waren, twee aan twee geboeid en in partijen van 50 aan één zware keten geklonken. Slaven werden ook geboeid door hun eigenaren c.q. opzichters als strafmaatregel of bij vluchtgevaar (Vrijman, 1927:94). \r\n\r\nBlijkens informatie van Dhr. Eygenberger waren deze boeien sinds 1946 in zijn bezit. Hij heeft hierover het volgende verteld:\r\n\"Baas Menig nodigde ons uit om in de Para bij Onoribo en Overtoom, in welke laatste hij woonde met zijn vrouw, trapoen te komen te hengelen en daartoe bij hem te komen overnachten. Voor een Westerling was de tocht per korjaal en een korte wandeling door een ruige wildernis reeds een openbaring en prachtig avontuur, waardoor zijn hart aan Suriname werd verpand. Het gezegde: 'Wie mopé heeft gegeten of Parawater heeft gedronken komt eens terug naar Suriname', is intussen bewaarheid geworden.\r\nDe avond voor de hengeltocht werd in het warme, voor muskieten gesloten huisje, bij het [...] licht van een kokolampoe doorgebracht, waarbij [...] gesprekjes werden gehouden, [...].\r\nOp die avond, vrienden voor het leven geworden zijnde, haalde Baas menig uit zijn donkere privéhoekje op zolder een slavenketting, die hij als erfstuk en aandenken aan voorouders zorgvuldig bewaard had. Hij bood het aan als geschenk met het verzoek er goed voor te zorgen, opdacht het nageslacht kennis kon nemen van vroegere tijden. [...].\r\nNadien, zomer 1946, zijn wij nooit meer een slavenketting in Suriname tegengekomen, noch hebben wij ooit van het vinden van een ander exemplaar gehoord. En dat ooit was 25 jaar later\".\r\n\r\nExcerpt from article Rijksmuseum, by Maria Holtrop, 2015: \r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how few slave shackles have survived; they were the iconic symbols of slavery and were frequently used in images of its abolition. At the end of the eighteenth century the slave in chains was already an important image illustrating the abomination of slavery and the festival linked to the emancipation is called ‘Keti koti’, or broken chains. Nevertheless we know nothing whatsoever about their provenance. It is also striking how little information there is about the use of slave shackles in the slavery literature. When there is a reference to punishment it is usually corporal punishment. Until now little has been known about how and when shackles were used in Suriname. ‘Baas Menig invited us to come and fish for tarpon in the Para River near Onoribo and Overtoom, where he lived with his wife, and to stay the night with them. … On that evening, we having become friends for life, Baas Menig fetched a slave shackle from his dark private corner in the attic, which he had carefully preserved as a family heirloom and memento of his ancestors. He offered it as a gift, asking me to look after it well so that future generations can learn about the past. …\r\nThe shackles were kept by a member of the Menig family, who came from the Overtoom plantation in the Para district in Suriname. On the plantation Frans Menig occupied himself with kulturu, which literally means culture, but in the broad sense of the word can refer to everything from the Creole way of life to Winti (fig. 4).7 He knew a lot about medicinal plants and was regarded as a wise man. He was usually addressed as ‘Baas’ as a sign of respect. The Menig family line begins with Frans Menig’s mother, Adolphina, who was born at Overtoom in 1856. In the emancipation of 1863, Adolphina, her mother Marcelina (1818), her grandmother Keetje (1802) and twenty-three other family members were given the surname Menig. The forebears of the Menig and Muntslag families had lived on the Overtoom plantation since the second half of the eighteenth century. This plantation was situated in the Para district to the southwest of Paramaribo, a region crossed by the Para Creek, on which all the plantations lay (fig. 6). Originally Overtoom was a sugar plantation, but at the end of the eighteenth century it became a timber estate.19 At the beginning of the nineteenth century Overtoom and Vreeland were clearly struggling again and the owners wanted to transfer their slaves to other plantations they owned, where coffee was grown. There were violent protests. The slaves did not want to leave the place where their forefathers were buried and where their families lived, and they were well aware that the work on timber estates was relatively agreeable. Evidently their protests were successful, as the overseers informed the owners that the slaves ‘are highlyunsuited to other work’ and moreoverit would not be possible ‘to take thenegroes to Para…willingly, as [they] are very attached to their lands’.28 In the nineteenth century Overtoom was a timber estate with a relatively large degree of freedom. The last owner had been a slave himself. Yet the slave shackle on display in the Rijksmuseum came from there. In the very detailed inventories of Overtoom that have survived (from 1742, 1767, 1771 and 1773) there is no mention of shackles, whereas that is often the case in other plantations’ inventories. This could indicate that shackles were not to be found at Overtoom until after 1773. Nonetheless the question remains as to what possible function they had, both during the period of slavery and afterwards. The first thing that emerges from the scant literature about the use of slave shackles is that they were used to prevent escape during transport.\r\nGert Oostindie writes that slaves who might have been risk factors on the plantation could be separated from the rest by means of shackles to prevent uprisings. Slaves who ran away and were recaptured were also put in chains. Sometimes they were actually kept in wrist fetters and even neck collars for months. Finally shackles were used in the case of sentences of hard labour. From 1784 it was no longer permitted to strike someone while he or she was suspended from a tree, but the Spaanse bok, a savage punishment whereby a slave was doubled over, tied to a stake in the ground and flogged until there was no skin left, was not abolished until 1828. What does this all say about the possible use of shackles on the Overtoom plantation? It seems unlikely that shackles were used at Overtoom to prevent flight or imposed in combination with hard labour, because it was a timber estate where slaves had to have a relatively large degree of freedom of movement to do their work. The fact that shackles are not mentioned in the very detailed inventory of 1742 may perhaps be explained because punishments restricting freedom by means of shackles were not meted out as much in the eighteenth century. Corporal punishment was far more common then. In the nineteenth century, by contrast, manacle punishments were used more often at the insistence of governors for fear of slave revolts. The shackles from Overtoom probably date from this period and were acquired to comply with the governor’s recommendations." .
