The name of the brand refers to the red lanterns (made of paper or fabric) that are used as lighting, usually during festive celebrations. Therefore, it has become an important festive decorative symbol in China. This model 753 was launched in 1976, its small size and loud volume made it reach the highest sales volume and the longest selling period of all radios in China. In the 1970s, the radio was the cheapest way of getting the latest entertainment, as televisions were unaffordable for most people.\r\n\r\nHannah Li, April 2019" .
