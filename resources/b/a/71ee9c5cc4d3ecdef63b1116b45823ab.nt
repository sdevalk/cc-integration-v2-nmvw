There is a pot with overflowing sweet or savory rice that is typical of the festival. This poster also wishes you a happy Pongal using the likeness of the Tamil filmstar Rajnikanth. At the top of the poster, he is pictured with a young girl, which is a reference to the film 'Anbulla Rajnikanth' that was released in 1984. In the film, he wins the heart of a young orphan girl. The Tamil script reads: PONGALO PONGAL' \twhich is the way to wish someone a happy Pongal in Tamil." .
