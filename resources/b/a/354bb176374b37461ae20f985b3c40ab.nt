Schmeltz 1903; beschrijvingskaart)\r\n\r\nKaili, boomerang like No. 1207-45, but one of the ends truncated. Cossack-district.\r\n\r\nKockatoos are killed by throwing the Kaili (Boomerang, Taf. II. Fig. 5-7), among a flock when flying in dense clouds along the creek or sitting in thick clusters on the branches of the gum-trees; and they rarely miss.\r\n\r\nFish is caught either with nets or are stupified by a Plant called \"kurrurru\" which is placed into the pools. After an hour or so, the fish come to the surface in a semicomatose state and are easily secured. In shallow water, the fish are killed by throwing the \"kaili\" (Taf. II. Fig. 18) at them, when they are 5 or 6 inches below the surface.\r\n\r\nThe writer saw a native in Cossack-creek kill eleven fishes, weighing from one to two pounds each, in less than half an hour, by means of the kaili.\r\n\r\nWordt gebruikt bij de visvangst.\r\n\r\nThe \"una\"dance is one of the most weird spectacles imaginable.\r\nSome 30 or 40 men (more in larger tribes), feather ornaments on head and upper arms, a wurrindi, or bunch of Emu-feathers [see No. 1321-19], coloured with wilgie hanging behind, from a hair-belt tied around the waist, a muljeddie of wood [see No's: 1207-73 and 1207-96] or Kangaroo-bone [see No. 1321-27], trough the septum of the nose, and painted with white and red stripes across the face, chest, abdomen and thighs, suddenly spring with a yell from the outer darkness into the bright fire circle.\r\n\r\nA short strong spear (about 6 feet long) in each hand, held perpendicularly, the shaft touching the ground, the body bent forward, eyes rolling and teeth glistening, they stamp with feet and spear shafts on the ground, keeping time to the songs of the old men, who click their kailis [see No's\"1207-46 and 1207-44] together and rattle their mihras [see No's: 1207-7, 1207-9 and 1321-66]." .
