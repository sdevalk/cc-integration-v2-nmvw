A beaded cloth is then sewn to the outside of the bark. The beaded cloth is manufactured separately. The whole process was the job of the women. A number of plant threads or fibres were stretched parallel to each other on a wooden board. The number of threads coincided with the desired number of beads in each row. Another long thread was used to make the cross connection. Both threads were pulled through the bead. In this warp-plaiting technique, a whole cloth with different patterns would be made. This one has rhomboid patterns on it. White, blue and red glass beads were used. These colours seemed to be the preferred ones for this type of cuff. \r\n\r\nBoth women and men would wear such a cuff around the wrist as personal adornment on everyday and special occasions and it would also serve as part of the bride price. It is often combined with upper arm bands and rings. \r\n\r\nThis kind of cuff was not worn by the inland people, but rather the coastal and island people around Manus. \r\n\r\n\r\n2802-128a en 2802-128b op één kaart ; een stel" .
