<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-362-6> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "362-6, WMR 17989\r\nTuscarora purses; RMV 362-6: cardboard, glazed cotton, glass; l. 9/13 cm., h. 7/8.5 cm., w. 4 cm.; WMR 17989: cardboard, cloth, glass; l. 13 cm., h. 8 cm.; both ca. 1880.\r\n\tPurplish-red glazed cotton and green glazed cotton line the outside and inside of the exquisite little lady's purse in the Leiden collection, decorated with flat and raised beadwork with flower, foliage and bird designs. This small bag is typical of a genre made for commercial sale and is a type of purse often purchased for children. An almost identical one can be seen being offered for sale at Niagara Falls in an 1889 photo made by J.G. Parks of Montreal (World Museum, Rotterdam nr. F 4995/78; see also: Hovens and Groeneveld 1992:57,101,107).\r\nThe Rotterdam specimen is simpler in execution. The white on red beadwork on both purses is typical of the work of Tuscarora women during the second half of the nineteenth century. Both specimens have similar beaded designs, with a bird taking centre stage. Large predatory birds are a typical motif in early Great Lakes Indian art and represent the Thunderer spirits of the upper world. Eagle motifs appear in tourist art at an early date, sometimes in combination with the American flag, and were intended to appeal to the nationalist sensibilities of the buyers. There is no indication that the little beaded birds on these purses and other Great Lakes souvenir arts of the period are derived from representations of the great supernatural beings of the upper world, although the persistent importance of bird motifs suggests continuity with earlier spiritual beliefs and imagistic traditions (cf. Phillips 1998:139-140).\r\n362-1, 6, 7, 13; 710-15, 26; 2012-10, 11, 12 Iroquois artifacts for the tourist trade\r\n\tBecause of the location of Niagara Falls within their territory, the Hodenosaunee (Iroquois) were the major suppliers of the souvenir arts sold there. Their main production was beadwork, applied in a number of distinctive styles and techniques to purses, moccasins, pincushions, and domestic ornaments that have been called \"whimsies,\" a term used for imaginative novelties by non-Native needleworkers during the Victorian era. Hodenosaunee people prefer to use the categorical term \"beadwork.\" Although Lewis Henry Morgan acknowledged the \"mixed character\" of these items, he also wrote that they \"furnish no slight indication of the artisan capacity\" (Tooker 1994:73).\r\nWomen's beadwork increasingly provided Hodenosaunee families with much needed cash income, and Hodenosaunee people consulted by Beverly Gordon, who has made the most extensive study of their beadwork, emphasized that many Indian families would not have been able to survive without manufacturing for the tourist market (Gordon 1984:65; Rickard 1992). Although production fell off during the twentieth century when other kinds of work became available, Hodenosaunee women have continued to make fine beadwork down to the present, both to ornament clothing worn by followers of the Longhouse religion and for sale. Contemporary Hodenosaunee regard beadwork as an important traditional art form (Hill 1994) and it is currently experiencing a revival.\r\nOn the Tuscarora Indian Reservation or at Niagara Falls Ten Kate purchased a number of Tuscarora \"whimsies,\" domestic ornaments of Euro-American derivation embellished with beadwork and moosehair embroidery (cf. Gordon, 1984, 1986; Harding 1994; Bol 1998:82-86,88; Phillips 1998:228-240). All the beadwork Ten Kate donated to the World Museum in Rotterdam have a cardboard base, covered with cloth of various colors with red clearly preferred. The bright and dark hued red and blue cloth set off the floral and zoomorphic designs (birds, butterflies), preferentially executed in white opaque raised beadwork.\r\n(Phillips 2008-09)\r\n\r\nDamestasje van karton, van buiten bekleed met paarse glanskatoen en van binnen met een groene stof. De randen zijn versterkt met repen wit linnen of katoen en het geheel is versierd met figuren bestaande uit glazen kralen, inclusief bloemen, bladeren en een vogel.\r\n\r\nLadies' bag. The base of the bag is made from carton. This is covered by purple cloth, probably silk or satin. On all sides and on all seams beadwork is applied,  including designs of flowers, foliage and a bird.\r\n\r\nDeze tasjes waren in Victoriaans Amerika in de mode." .
