Steel rond, naar boven dikker met puntig boveneind, op het midden rondgaande banden. Rond gat voor de koker, daarnaast visgraatvormig gevlochten rotanringen.\r\n\r\nThe stone axe is according to Sande the most important agricultural instrument. People living in fast regeneration forests daily need these tools to make the forest moving back, to open gardens, to get wood for the houses, and to get firewood. The instrument was used to knock-off superficial scales, whereby the convex shape prevent the edge of the axe going deeply into the wood, being driven again to the surface. The fastening of the stone in the stone holder, is done by rattan rings which, by being forced along the conically shaped wood, cause the highest degree of tightness. The rattan rings plaited on the handle thinner part were forced down to the thicker part by knocking on them with small hammer. These precautions prevent the breakage of the tool. Head pivoting stone axes were used in other regions in New Guinea (Manokwari, Enarotali and on the south east coast of New Guinea from Merauke to Kerema, see the map , Pétrequin, 2006, 318) always in coastal areas and often linked with Austronesian languages. When Wirz published his study dealing with Sentani Lake (1928), iron axes, introduced from the  first colonial station funded in 1902 in Humboldt Bay, replaced the stone ones. Until the 1980s’, stone axes were always used in exchanges and also as a bridewealth." .
