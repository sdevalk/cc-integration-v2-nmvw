It was found in the depot of the museum but it is unknown whether it belongs to a spear in the collection or whether it is just by itself.  \r\n\r\nThose spear heads were either directly tied to the handle or tied to a wooden joint between blade and handle. The lacing was coated with Parinarium putty.\r\n\r\nSplinters and bigger parts of obsidian, which were needed for the daggers and spears were hewn off with stones. This was done by expert men, who exactly knew the physical qualities of the stone and therefore knew where to hit. Most of  the blades were pear-shaped with the biggest lower part being attached to the wooden shaft. All the obsidian is originally from Lou Island, whose people at first had the monopoly on spears and daggers with obsidian blades. Through trade relations though, the obsidian also spread across to the main island and the little islands around, which then started to manufacture those weapons themselves. Deep shafts were dug out, in which men worked with torches to produce the obsidian. Big blocks of it were either directly processed on Lou island or traded to the other islands. In the period of 3,200 to 2,500 years ago, the Lou Island obsidian had been transported to places as far as Borneo in the west and Vanuatu in the east, covering a span of 5,700 km.\r\nThe spears were used in open battle and would be hurled from the distance. The heavier obsidian-tipped spears were more suitable for shorter distances or were thrust into the enemies body." .
