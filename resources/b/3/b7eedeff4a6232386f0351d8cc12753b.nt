Lum wanted to engage with research about the fundamental theories and thought production which informed the formation of the Ethnographic museum. He cites the work of Michel de Certeau as important to his understanding of the desire to create a museum of ethnology as well as challenges the notions set out by later anthropologist such as Margret Mead and Paul Kane. He uses these ideas to for his work created for the Volkenkunde. Each mirror would be laser cut into profiles of faces.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the choice of material, Lum explains in his proposal: “…I wanted an image that returns back to the time of the museum’s founding. According to de Certeau, the arrival of ethnology also marks the turning point in the Enlightenment project, as the views of the Same come into repeated conflict with the presence of the Other. For this reason, I propose to use mirrored glass as my material, the mirror being the symbolic material of the Enlightenment.”\r\n\r\n These profiles are based on the racially charged imagery founded by the social “scientist”, early anthropologist Jules Virey, whose comparison went on to form and corroborate much of the racial typing which happened in the mid 19th century when he compared the European and African head to that of an ape. His work in ethnic typecasting, Lum argues, also has antecedence in the Dutch anatomist Petrus Campers depictions. Lum’s work begs one to “reflect” on this abhorrent history which is inextricably linked to the formation of the museum itself, and roots in Dutch history.\r\n\r\n In his mirrors one can see themselves as well as be reminded of what one’s own features mean now, in a contemporary context in relation to the identity formation pushed on us by others, but also in that which was a formation of power structures, exclusion, and enslavement/inequality in times past. His piece is highly critical of the museum and was meant to be features in the main entrance hall. He refers to the profiles of the persons carved into the mirror as “three monkeys.” His piece is meant to “replicate the dilemmas” of the museum, what is to be done about these images; the shapes the mirrors are carved into. Once one looks into the mirror these issues can no longer be ignored." .
