The painting depicts the Ganiny. Ganiny is a sacred ceremonial object which is held while dancing. It is a part of a sacred and secret ceremony (ususally a mortuary ceremony) belonging to the Yirritja peopleand performed by by men only. The ceremony is held under a sacred paperbark tree which is also symbolic and an important part of the ceremony. Use of the diamond design links the Yirritja clans to their ancestral sources in the Dreaming - it means they are from Barama. The diamond can represent water flowing, bees and honey, low tide, salt water pools or sacred fire. In this story the Ganiny has been used to take the paper bark off a tree and honey has splashed onto the Ganiny. This is the diamond shape going down the middle of the Ganiny. The white tips represent the paperbark (Mardulka). This also is the same white that is painted on the local Aboriginals (Yolngu) forehead in funeral ceremonies. The surrounding crosshatching is the sea. In areas the tide is coming in and going out depending on the angles of the lines formed. The sea has been stopped in areas with the horizontal lines of the river passing through. These horizontal bands are also symbolic of the scars found on the chest of initiated males. Sections surrounding the Ganiny depicts the other clans, including Warramirri., Madarrapa as well as the Gumati clan in the top area. The diamonds down the middle of the painting represent the Gumatj fire. Red being the fire and black being the coals. The Gumatj fire is linked back to the Dreamtime. Any other story cannot be told. It remains sacred and secret to the Gumatj people. (this story was told by the artist).\r\n\r\n\r\nBARK PAINTING, ARNHEM LAND\r\nThe first bark paintings probably were made on the inside of rain shelters. Lengths of Eucalyptus bark were attached with their smooth insides to simple frames of branches. People then would decorate the bark during periods of forced idlenesss. 19th century explorers reported that bark paintings were an important factor in rituals and ceremonies. Today this is still the case in Arnhem Land. The choice and treatment of subjects was limited by cultural and religious traditions. Some of the paintings could only be exposed to initiated people.\r\n\r\nThe wet season is the best time to harvest because it is then flexible and easy to remove. Two rings are cut into the trunk with a sharp axe. These are are subsequently connected with a vertical cut. As the bark is flexible and damp it is easy to peel it off. The loose bark on the outside is chopped away. Subsequently, the remaining bark is put on a steady burning fire face down. Because of the heat the bark flattens and moisture evaporates. Weighed down with stones the bark is left for a few days. To keep the bark from warping there are sometimes later sticks attached tot he top and bottom.\r\n\r\nArnhem Land artists rarely use colours other than the basic red, yellow, black and white. Red and yellow are derived from the ochres that are found in the ochre pits. Black derives from charcoal. White is made from plaster or pipe clay. The material is finely ground and mixed with water, then mixed with a binder. The simple throw-away brushes are made of bark fibres, human hair, chewed twigs and thin shoots. Subjects portrayed are related to daily life. On the coast, for example, the hunting of turtle, dugong, crocodile and all kind of fish are depicted. Inland, the hunting of kangaroos, fresh water crocodiles and birds. Other images have to do with personal totem stories and Dreamtime histories.\r\n\r\nWithin Arnhem Land art there are distinct regional styles. The famous x-ray style is mostly found in the western part. Not only the outside of a human being, animal or spirit is painted, but also important organs and the spine. These painting often have a plain background and one or two figures, one of them being a Mimi spirit. The most important parts of the work are covered with cross lines. These patterns are individual, every artist having his own pattern. \r\nWhen we look at the choice of subject and technique, there is a strong resemblance to the old rock paintings in this area. The art in the northern and eastern part of Arnhem Land is more colourful and intricate. Often, the whole bark is covered with figures and abstract, geometric patterns. Frequently, there is a border around the painting and the work is divided into segments representing different stories. In Arnhem Land there is more of an exchange between different groups. Art there is open to change. The composition is more than the intricate attention to details and thus acquires greater vitality.\r\n\r\nELCHO ISLAND ART & CRAFT\r\nElcho Island is situated approx 55kms North East of Darwin, Australia.\r\nElcho Island is amongst the Wessel Islands and part of aboriginal owned land in \"Arnhemland\" Australie. The island is approx 50 kms long and 6 kms wide.  The settlement called 'Galiwin' Ku' is situated at the southern end of the Island but there are also many 'outstations' scattered on the mainland and surrounding islands.'The population of 'Galiwin' Ku' and its outstations is approx 1500.\r\n\r\nElcho island is a dry community (no alcohol) and is a closed community (permits required before entry).\r\nThe local aboriginal people of North East Arnhemland are called 'Yolngu' while the white European is called a 'Balanda'.\r\nYolngu culture nis still very much alive here where people continue to live, hunt and practise traditional ceremonies.\r\n\r\nThe main ceremonies are held for funerals which can go day and night for many weeks. Another ceremony can be held for circumsicion of yong boys between 8-12 years old. There are still 'mens business and women business' ceremonies held. They are held secretely and are very sacred and will not be discussed with the outside population.\r\n\r\nElcho island has a history of trading with the macassan people for hundred of years. They traded trepang( sea slug) to the Macassans for metal, cloth and tabacco. This was  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe first bark paintings probably were made on the inside of rain shelters.
