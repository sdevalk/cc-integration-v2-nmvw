<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/IB2020-2-4> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Part of a 1934 transfer from the Victoria and Albert Museum, this cloak was long associated with Kamehameha 1, who unified\r\nthe Hawaiian lslands in the early nineteenth century. lt has recently been established that it was in fact brought to England by his son, Kamehameha Il, also known as Liholiho. who was famous for his repudiation of the 'aikapu system of taboos and religious observances, enabling conversion to Christianity. In 1823, anxious to strengthen the diplomatic ties between the Kingdom of Hawai'i and the British Empire, he led a delegation including his wife, Queen Kamämalu, and other highranking Hawaiians to England. They brought a number of ahu'ula, feather cloaks, and other high-status artefacts for presentation as gifts. The pany arrived at Portsmouth in March 1824 and settled in London. Tragically before they were able to meet King George IV, members of the delegation contracted measles and both the King and Queen died in July. The surviving members of the group returned to Hawaiï with the coffins of the King and Queen  on board HMS Blonde, and a State funeral was held in May 1825. It is likely that the various ahu'ula and other gifts were distributed, either by Kamehameha Il and Kamämalu before their deaths, or by the chiefs who accompanied them afterwards. This cloak features a unique barkcloth lining on the inside of the cloak, across the area that would have covered the shoulders and neck of the wearer. The kapa, barkcloth, is decorated with two bands of semicercles filled with black and red geometric motifs. This cloth exhibits considerable wear, it has been repeatedly stitched back together and even patched up with a piece of yellow European cloth. Kamehameha's 'ahu'ula is an exceptionally poignant artefact of an encounter missed: what would have been a historic meeting between the King and King George IV. Whether this doak was worn personally by Kamehameha Il, or whether it\r\nwas brought as a diplomatic gift with George IV or anyone else in particulal in mind, cannot now be determined. The cloak is, however, a potent relic of Polynesian royalty, and a compelling expression of the long global history of Polynesian efforts to reach out and engage with Europeans diplomatically. \r\n\r\n(Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts, p.297)\r\nFeathered cloaks, capes and helmets were visueal objectifications of social inequality. They were worn by male chiefs in dangerous or sacred situations and carried the social methaphor that one's genealogy is one's sacred protection. The feathers were primarily red from a honeycreeper, the i'iwi bird. Designs were incorporated as the feathers were tied to the bakcing of knotted fibre by adding yellow feathers or occasionaly black or green feathers from other honeycreepers or honeyeaters. Yellow feathers came from birds that were primarily black- the yellow tufts were removed and the bird released- making yellow feathers rare and valuable. (...)\r\nHawaiian featherwork was part of a system of sacred symbols and ritual objectifications. The term symbol is generally regarded as something that stands for or represents something else. The term here referes to the visible manifestation of invisible concepts or knowledge and specifically to concepts about embodiement of the divine. In Hawaií, the divine was transmitted genealogically from the gods to chiefs, whose bodies were vessels of divine sacredness (mana). The most sacred parts of a chief's body were the head (especially the top of the head) and the back (especially the backbone). It was necessary to protect these body parts during dangerous or sacred situations, and feathered helmets, cloaks, and capes protected and drew attention to them.(...) The base of the feathered cloak was nae, a net structure of olona fibre. This bakcing was often in small pieces, made by several people of varying skill. If the nae was fabricated while chanting prayers, it could entangle or capture (hoóheihei) them to serve as perpetual prayers to protect its wearer. The addition of red feathers gave the nae even more sanctity. Red was the sacred colour in Hawaii as elsewhere in Polynesia, and red feathers were considered among the most sacred natural products. (...) Sacred red feathers attached to a perpetual prayer backing constitued protection for the sacred backbone of a chief. Red feathers activitaed that to which they were attached, including images of the great gods Kukaílimoku and Lono. A temple ceremony kauila huluhulu focused on readorning the images with feathers. (...)\r\nFeathered cloaks could be acquired by appropriation or inheritance. If a chief was killed in battle, his cloak would be taken as a battle prize. After a chief's natural deathm his cloak would be kept by his sonm as a symbol of his legitimate acquisition of power. Liholiho (kamehameha II) had three cloaks - one he inherited with the sacred mana of hisfather Kamehameha the Great; one embedded the power of Kamehameha's paternal line in that it had been the cloak of Kekuaokalani(son of Kamehameha's full brother), taken as a battle prize by Liholihom thereby consolidating his power; and one embedded the sacredness of Liholiho's mother's line, having belonged to Kiwalaó(Liholiho's mother's father) taken as a battle prize by Kamehameha I.\r\nIt is unlikely that Liholiho (or any other Hawaiian) ever wore these cloaks bbecause of the important tapu against wearing clothing that had touched the body of someone else, especially the body of a high chief. Clothing embodied personal mana and individuals who did not respect prohibitins were vulnerable to sorcery. (...)f\r\nDuring the 18th centuyr, feathered cloaks were protective devices worn during sacred and dangerous situations; during the 19th century, Hawaiian chiefs wore feathered cloaks as visual expression of status and prestige on ceremonial occasions.\r\n\r\n(Kaeppler A.L., The Pacific Arts of Polynesia and Micronesia, Oxford University Press, 2008, p.119-125)\r\n\r\nChiefs (ali'i) traced their lines of descent from the gods of creation. Many of these gods were linked to birds ; birds could fly between and connect the realms of the living and the divine. The shape and wing-like designs of the cloaks made clear an ali'i's close connection to feathered gods, while red and yellow feathers wree seen to attract the gods positive attention.\r\n\r\n(Newell Jenny,Pacific Art in Detail, The British Museum Press, 2011, p.82)" .
