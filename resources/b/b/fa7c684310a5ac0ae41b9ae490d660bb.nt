<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-2385-28> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This rare ceremonial dance ornament represents a fish-hawk (parpara). Its beak, head, hull and tail are carved from a single piece of wood. The bird is largely decorated with coix seeds and abrus pips. Its eyes are also indicated by abrus pips. The beak and other parts without pips have been painted yellow. There are a few real feathers attached to the body, mainly on the tail and wings. On the bottom there is a hole to which a stick was attached by means of which the ornament was carried above the bearer's head. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \r\nAccording to the donor, children carried this object attached to a stick during the parade in honour of the marriage of Princess Juliana of the Netherlands.\r\n  \r\nThe bird ornament is a replica of the Mahu-ze clan emblem representing a totemic ancestor/animal, whose ritual significance and cultural symbolism are rooted in Marind mythology. According to van Baal precise identification of this predatory bird is impossible. All we know for sure is that among the Marind a fish-eating bird is a totem. It is classified with the Mahu-ze (and especially with one of its sub-clans, which proclaims itself the excrement clan) because \"this genus of the hawk family has been observed to feed on excrements on the beach\" (Van Baal, 1966: 334).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \r\nI could not find any relevant information connected with the fish-hawk. Thought it might be not relevant I present information about the hawk, called keke, which is mythologically connected with the castration anxiety and hais. The myth runs as follows. \"Beto, a Mahu-ze dema, lived near Wendu. He caught a nambimb-fish and while he was eating it, a hawk (keke) suddenly swept down and snatched his kekewin, the shell worn by Marind men just over that part of the girdle which keeps the foreskin pressed tightly against the abdomen when the penis is drawn up. ... Beto went to his friend Na-anem (i.e. Excrement-man) to spend the night in his house. ... Beto entered, a hais (spirit of the dead) slipped in with him. The moment Beto lay down, the hais attacked and strangled him. Then Beto woke up, he had only dreamt of the hawk which stole his girdle-shell\" (ibid.: 318).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\nVan Baal notes that according to Wirz there is a analogy between the hawk and the hais because of the similarity of this grey-brown bird and the spirit behaviour; they both appear out of nowhere and all of a sudden vanish again (ibid.: 318).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \r\nIVANA HLADKA, 28.11. 2006" .
