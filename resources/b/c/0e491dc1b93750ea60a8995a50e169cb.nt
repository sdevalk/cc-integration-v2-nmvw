In ordinary houses these posts were undecorated but in the ondoforo’s (chief) dwelling, the central posts were elaborately carved (see also 3103-1). A number of these supports have survived because they were made of a borer-resistant wood, and are the only relics of buildings that have long since fallen to ruin. The house posts were made of the trunk of the trees with heavy buttresslike roots. This root end was usually trimmed to leave winglike projections on either side, forming a kind of fork on which the ridge pole could rest, the other end of the inverted trunk being sunk in the water where the chief’s house was being built. The wings were decorated with a pierced, curvilinear pattern. A common motif was a stylized representation of the lizard, which was found on the trunk as well, sometimes in relief and sometimes in round with only the legs connected to the tree. Crocodiles, dogs, and human figures were carved as well.\r\nThe size, the construction and the ornamentation of his house also reflected the ondoforo power. Sentani houses were built on pilings out in the water. Rectangular in shape, they varied in length from about thirty to ninety feet (9 to 27 m). They had a ridge pole, and the sloping sides of the roof outlined the triangular walls at the front and the back. The walls along the sides, which were very low were hidden by the roof coming down to the ground. The central passage running from front to back had a number of rooms on each side. These rooms were created by screens made from the midribs of sago leaves, and between the rooms there were open spaces with large fireplaces." .
