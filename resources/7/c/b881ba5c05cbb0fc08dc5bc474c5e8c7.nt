This specimen is lost); 1 plainware jar sherd (with rounded, fine quartz sand temper). This is probably a Bylas phase (1175/1200-1300) assemblage. As defined by Johnson and Wasley (1966), the Bylas phase was a time in the Gila Valley from the gorge east of Safford to San Carlos when the farming population lived in surface rooms built using adobe reinforced with rocks arranged around a courtyard in areas above the river convenient for farming. Identifying indigenous ceramics include plain and corrugated utilitarian ware, and Casa Grande Red-on-buff (Safford Variety) and San Carlos Red-on-brown ware" .
