It has a wooden head with a long beak and eyes which are indicated by abrus pips. The long wooden neck is on the top partly decorated with red feathers. The body is made from wood, and sago leaf stem is used to imitate bird feathers and tightened with rattan. There are also a few real feathers attached to the body, mainly on the sides. The bottom of the body is painted red. There is no hole at the bottom which indicates that the figure was not carried on a stick but was attached by means of a rattan rope to the bearer's head in such a way that the bird's beak would hover over his forehead. Sometimes a real stork head is used (Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 11, Fig. 4).                                     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t The black-and-white stork is a very common mythical ancestor/animal within Marind myths and ceremonies. The origin of the first stork is mentioned in the myth about one of Geb's sons - snake Uaba. He and his wife Ualiwamb were caught by Aramemb (main dema of Aramemb phratry) while engaged in sexual intercourse. Aramemb frees Uaba while a flame shoots from Ualiwamb's vulva (the origin of fire). From here also emerges the first stork, symbol of initiation, and the first cassowary (Van Baal, 1966: 243-245). Ndik is both dema and clan totem linked with clan groupings - Ndik-end of the Aramemb phratry. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t The stork plays an important role in the myth of the origin of mankind; the fish-shaped first human beings were picked out of the water by a stork and later shaped into human beings by Aramemb and his fire (ibid.: 209-210). \r\nThe stork's mythological ancestor is Wonatai, a dema who can change himself into a stork or a human. He is \"the mythical wati-bringer and as such he is inseparably connected with all feasts and ceremonies, wati being a vital ingredient on any festive occasion\" (ibid.: 303). \r\nIn myths he is the rival of the eagle dema. Their conflict started when the eagle committed adultery with the stork's wife. \r\n\r\nThe stork figure is carried on a head of a waiko-dancer /ceremonial performer or mayo-novice during mayo ritual celebrations connected with the re-enactment of a particular mythical episode. Towards the end of the mayo initiation ceremony \"the miakim (and the amnangib, the married male novices) have yet another ornament, viz. the head and the plumes of the ndik. The ndik's head is perched right on top of the hairdo\" (ibid.: 534).\r\n\r\nNdik also plays an important role, re-enacted by a dema-performer during important mourning rituals of mayo. The myth episode is re-enacted by two dancing storks and two dog dema-performers (TM-number: 5969-74, Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 54, Fig. 12 and Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 51, Fig. 1).\r\n\r\nAccording to van Baal the stork dema-performer wears a carved stork head ornament, made partly from real stork feathers and partly imitated by sago-leaf stems. He dances while his arms slowly move up and down imitating the flight of the stork. The performer's face is covered with a bower bird face shield to which cassowary and bird of paradise feathers have been attached. His body is covered with a costume made of fibres.\r\n\r\nThe western Marind people perform during their ritual celebrations the uar-ti-zi (Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 25, Fig. 1, 2, 3), the imo cult dance performed by dancers decorated with stork feathers. This dance is an equivalent of the eastern waiko-zi, the mayo cult dance. \"It is also preceded by a dema-wir [Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 9], which is opened by a performer representing a hais and wearing the hais-mask... Then at last the uar-ti-zi performers arrive. ... On their heads they wear a kind of small gari,... Projecting from the hairdo, a long rod passes through this headgear. At the top are a few storks' feathers, from which the dance derives its name. ... the uar-ti-zi is danced by miakim and married men only. ... Stork's feathers are the distinctive ornaments of the fully initiated men\" (ibid.: 854-855). The dancer has been further decorated with croton leaves and plays a big drum.\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 20.11. 2006" .
