It was incorporated into the Belgian honours system on 10 October 1908 following the annexation of the Congo Free State by Belgium. The motto of the Order is \"Travail et progrès\" (French: Labour and progress). The King of the Belgians is its Grand Master. Even though Congo is no longer a Belgian colony, it is still considered to be a Belgian Order.\r\n\r\nThe Order of the African Star is awarded by Royal Decree. Following the independence of Congo in 1960, the Order of the African Star is no longer awarded (although it still exists).\r\n\r\nFrom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_African_Star\r\n\r\nThis medal may have been awarded to S.G. Vreezen." .
