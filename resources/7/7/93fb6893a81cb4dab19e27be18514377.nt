On the walls of the outer enclosure of this palace a procession of elephants are sculptured in alto-relievo. The procession appears to represent a hunting party passing through a forest, as a variety of trees fill up the background, and animals, such as the stag, are sculptured beneath; while the elephant shewn in the photograph is carrying what appears to be an animal coiled up in its trunk. The figures seated on the saddles are armed with bow and arrow. In another part of this building, figures of Garuda support the entablature of a causeway in place of pillars, as in the case of the Cariatides of Greece.\r\nThe leper king, after whom this place is named, is said to have died of leprosy, for having deserted the snake-worship of his forefathers. The tradition goes on to say, that after having married the snake god's daughter, he erected the image of the four-faced Phrohm over the gateway of the city, and also over the towers of his temple, to scare away the enraged parent. An angel is also said to have descended from heaven in the shape of a physician, who offered to remove the king's distemper by plunging him into a trough of boiling medicine. His majesty, strange to say, was incredulous. The physician, in a fit of rage, entered a fiery chariot, and ascended to heaven, having upset the trough, and the king died. (*)\r\n\r\n(*) Some intelligent natives informed us they were quite sure they knew where the medicine was still to be found.\r\n\r\nin: Album \"The antiquities of Cambodia a series of photographs taken on the spot With Letterpress Description By John Thomson, F.R.G.S., F.E.S.L., Edinburgh: Edmonston & Douglas MDCCCLXVII\"; opgenomen in KIT Library ILS (RF-279) page 71." .
