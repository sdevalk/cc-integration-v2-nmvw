Until the 19th century, when whaling moved from the Arctic to the tropical seas of the Pacific, Hawaiians would not hunt for whales. However, all parts of the beached mammals were considered property of the chief.  Honolulu on O‘ahu and Lahaina on Maui became important whaling ports where ships hunting in the Japan Sea, the South Pacific and later again the Arctic stopped to replenish stocks and change crews. The transiting of whale oil for lamps, heating and lubrication for industrial machinery and baleen strips for use in corsets, skirt hoops, umbrellas and buggy whips transformed these Hawaiian ports into international hubs starting in 1819. The local whaling economy surged especially after 1830 when the sandalwood trade to China was completely replaced by an economy centred around pork and yam provisions for the whalers.  \r\n\r\nDespite the wide availability of whale bone because of the whaling industry, the Aotearoa-New Zealand researcher Te Rangi Hiroa documents walrus ivory being used to make hangers for the lei niho palaoa.  He also demonstrated that most of the hooks were made in post-contact times. Between 1790 and 1810 a large amount of walrus ivory reached Hawai‘i – the place to take in provisions – as a side product of the transpacific fur trade between the American Northwest Coast and China.  While no testing has been done on the NMvW necklaces, close physical examination suggests that the hooks were indeed made of whale ivory. \r\n\r\nThe Rotterdam lei niho palaoa (WM-3125) was donated to the museum by E.E. St. Martin in 1885. I think the initials refer to Etienne Elie St. Martin, who most probably was related to Maria Cornelia St. Martin, the grandmother of Elie van Rijckevorsel (1845-1928), whose objects form the founding collection of the Rotterdam Wereldmuseum.  The trajectory of this necklace is yet unclear as information on how E.E. St. Martin acquired the object or why he donated the necklace to the Museum in Rotterdam has not surfaced. But the Saint Martins and the van Rijckevorsels were important shipping company owners and merchants which makes the probability of the necklace reaching Rotterdam via merchant ships highly plausible.\r\n\r\nHistoric sources document that the hair used came from the women of the attendants of the chief. To that purpose they would let the hair grow for six to seven years, period by which it would have reached the ankles. The donation of hair coming from the head, the most sacred or tapu part of the body, was considered the utmost sign of devotion.  The archaeologist Patrick Vinton Kirch suggests that the style of the ornament is derived from shapes found in the Hawaiian archipelago from the end of the first millennium onwards. He thinks that the use of whale ivory was a later development becoming prevalent when whaling vessels started stopping in Hawai‘i to replenish their supplies.  \r\n\r\nThere is debate about to what the shape of the carved whale ivory refers. A popular interpretation has been that it refers to the tongue of a god, but the British dermatologist and microbiologist who collected in Hawai‘i, Eduard Arnings (1855-1936) surmised it might even represent the tongue of an enemy.  The anthropologist Adrienne Kaeppler suggested that the evolution of the shape of the lei niho palaoa may have been an artistic interpretation of the naturally curved whale’s tooth.  Moreover, it mimics the outline of feathered crest-shaped helmets (mahiole), which, when worn together with the necklace, frame the head, containing the mana, the power and essence of the ali‘i. Hence, the art historian Stacey Kamehiro offers the more recent interpretation of seeing the whale ivory curve as a vessel for mana.  The symbolic meaning is enhanced by the materials used: human hair coming from the most sacred part of the body is associated with whale’s tooth, a relatively rare and sacred material from the sea, make this ornament particularly suitable for gods and chiefs.  \r\n\r\nThe lei niho palaoa with the most complex and ancient collecting history belongs to the Tropenmuseum collection (TM-A-2415). Before incorporating the Tropenmuseum collection in 1923, the lei niho palaoa was part of the Royal Zoological Society Natura Artis Magistra (Artis), founded in 1838 in Amsterdam. Artis still exists today as a zoo in the centre of Amsterdam. At the beginning, it not only collected living exotic animals, but also rocks, samples of natural history and ethnographic objects. The Artis collection was first on display in 1851 in the Groote Museum (Large Museum) and then in the Kleine Museum (Small Museum) until it became too small to hold the collections. It was thus transferred to the Societeit Amicitiae (Society of Friends) that gave the collections its own building in 1888, named the Volharding (Perseverance).  The Artis documentation states that the object was collected by Captain Jacobus Boelen (1791-1876) during a global trading mission on the Wilhelmina & Maria designed to link the markets of the west coast of Latin America with those of East Asia and the Indies.  He and his men stayed in the Hawaiian archipelago for six weeks starting on 29 January 1828. They loaded some 3,500 piculs of sandalwood to offload into an American ship headed for Canton.  Boelen’s collection date of this necklace is only preceded by the early American whaling voyages starting in 1801 and the Russian voyages of Lisiansky (1803-1806) and Kotzebue, 1815-1818. The objects assembled during the voyage of H.M.S. Blonde (1824-1826) are now in different British and American (including Hawai‘i) museums.  Also shortly after the arrival of the first missionaries from the American Board of Commissions for Foreign Missions in 1820, objects were collected.  \r\n\r\nBoelen and his men stopped at Kealakekua and Kailua Bays on the big island of Hawai‘i, at Honolulu on O‘ahu and Waimea on Kaua‘i.  They met with a great number of ali‘i, high ranking chiefs including “Koakini”, the chief of the island of Hawai‘i from 1820 until 1844, whose full name was John Adams Kiʻiapalaoku Kuakini (1789-1844).  He was also received by Chieffess Kapi‘olani (c. 1781-1841) who was one of the first Hawaiians to read, write and convert to Christianity and her husband Haiha Nāihe, chief of Kealakekua. Boelen describes meetings with Kakupuohi, one of the wives of Kalani‘ōpu‘u, king of Hawai‘i between 1778 and 1791 and Kamānele (1814-1834) whom Boelen calls “princess Koakini” who was promised to be married to the soon to become King Kamehameha III. Christened Mele, she died at the age of twenty. He also encountered William Pitt Leleiōhoku, a grandson of King Kamehameha I who became governor of Hawai‘i in 1846  and the young Kauikeaouli, who’s regent Ka‘ahumanu (1768-1832), favourite wife of Kamehameha I was actually governing the islands in his place.  Boelen ranks among one of the earliest eyewitness accounts of happenings in Hawai‘i.  \r\n\r\nAfter getting acquainted with the 14-year old Kauikeaouli, King Kamehameha III (1814-1854), Captain Boelen was very dismayed about all those traders who abused the youth of the king to ‘cajole him into giving the valuable costumes of his forefathers which the chiefs of these islands used to wear’. He thought that ‘there will be a time, that the absence of the testaments to their past customs, ways of living and history and the passing of those into foreign hands, who falter their innocence, will be mourned too late’.   A profound respect for Hawaiian material culture transpires from Boelen’s writing. While he has not documented the exact circumstances of collecting this lei niho palaoa, it seems likely that he did not exchange it, but that it was a gift from his chiefly hosts. \r\n\r\nOther facts would confirm this hypothesis. Kauikeaouli, became known during his reign as the king who initiated the formal recognition of the Hawaiian state in 1842, for which he sent representatives to the United States, England, German states and France.  His father Kamehameha, was a conquering chief from Kohala on the island of Hawai‘i who forcefully expanded his territory to include Hawai‘i, Maui, O‘ahu, Lāna‘i, Kaho‘olawe and Moloka‘i. In 1810 Kamehameha managed to negotiate the inclusion of Kaua‘i and Ni‘ihau and thus unite the major Hawaiian islands in one kingdom creating the Kamehameha dynasty of which he was the first ruler. Carrying on the diplomatic legacy of his father, Kauikeaouli (Kamehameha III) invested in maintaining fruitful relations with foreign nations during his reign from 1825 to 1854.  He is for example known to have given feather cloaks to American, British and Polynesian diplomats and officials." .
