<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7158-369> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This is a depiction of the Hindu god Hanuman, who is considered the loyal companion of Rama. He is prominently featured in the epic story the Ramayana and the vernacular story Ramcharitmanas, which retell the story of Rama, his exile, and the kidnapping of Rama's wife Sita from Ravana, the king of Lanka. Hanuman is a monkey-god, with simian physical features. He performs extraordinary feats of strength, such as moving mountains, due to his devotion to Rama. He is worshipped widely in India and the Hindu diaspora. He is particularly important in forms of Caribbean Hinduism, as people who left to work on plantations in the Caribbean, especially to Suriname, came from regions that worshipped Ram and read the Ramcharitmanas text. This poster has the phrase 'Sri Ram' written around it, which is considered itself a prayer of obeisance to Ram. \r\nThis poster itelf is notable because it was printed by the Brijbasi Sons press. In the 19th century, popular devotional prints like these became widely circulated. Many were made as chromolithographs. These are colour printed images printed from stone blocks. These images were not considered 'high art' either in India or in Europe--there was a certain disdain for this widely circulated art form due to its bright colours and ready availability. S.S. Brijbasi and Sons was a prominent press based out of Karachi, from 1918 until 1947." .
