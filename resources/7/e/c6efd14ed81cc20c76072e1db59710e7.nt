The female figures shewn occur in groups throughout the walls of the entire building. They are nearly life-size, and are known to the natives as the Chao Savan, who are supposed to form the retinue of the deified kings. They are found almost invariably wearing this three-pointed crown; and the same subjects are again found on a smaller scale, as Tewadah (angels), floating in mid-air above some of the bas-relief representations, and sculptured in dancing attitudes on the frieze of the inner galleries.\r\n\r\nin: Album \"The antiquities of Cambodia a series of photographs taken on the spot With Letterpress Description By John Thomson, F.R.G.S., F.E.S.L., Edinburgh: Edmonston & Douglas MDCCCLXVII\"; opgenomen in KIT Library ILS (RF-279) page 45." .
