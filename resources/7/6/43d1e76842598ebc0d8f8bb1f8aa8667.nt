<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7085-2> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "A long rectangular panel made of wood. This panel is one of the very few remaining representational documents of headhunting in Mentawai. It depicts a victim killed during a headhunting raid. It has been hewn with an adze out of a huge plank of tropical hardwood, the details of the figure were then elaborated with a carving knife. It had been inserted in the back wall of the first interior room of a longhouse (uma) in Taileleu in Southern Siberut and was acquired in that village in 1967 by Reimar Schefold from the about 60 year old son of the maker who thought it might have been fabricated shortly before he was born, thus around the turn of the Century. The original house had collapsed but he had stored the panel for potential further use as a board in a new house. Children had played with it and damaged the surface at various places. \r\nThe former owner said that the victim depicted was a man from Tatubeket in Northern Siberut and that the painted lozenges in the upper half of the panel were to make it more beautiful. What according to him was very special and where he was proud of was the fact that the figure has no arms, testifying the fact that the participants of the relevant headhunt had not only taken the head but also the arms of the victim with them. Among the five remaining headhunting figures known to have survived from Taileleu this is indeed the only one having this peculiarity. \r\nTaking the heads and sometimes also the arms and feet of a killed enemy was a custom the Mentawaians were feared for. The practice was brought to an end by the Dutch Colonial Government only in the first decade of the 20th Century. Until 1996 the panel has for several years been given in loan to the Tropenmuseum as a part of the standing exhibition `Mens&Milieu'." .
