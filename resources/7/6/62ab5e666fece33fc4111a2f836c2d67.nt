Please remember, the painting dates from 1823 or slightly earlier. Consequently, the painter Kawahara Keiga couldn't avail himself of aerial photography, a helicopter or an airplane. And yet, he must have walked around, sketching as if from a high viewpoint or at least, suggesting to the viewer of the painting that he, indeed, saw this landscape from such a high viewpoint. In addition to the normal practice of a painter, consisting in the creation of an illusion that we are looking at a three-dimensional reality rendered in the two dimensions of a flat surface, Keiga managed to add a third dimension, often called the bird's-eye view. \r\nIt is true that the first such view was a creation of the Italian Jacopo di Barbari, creating a similar view of the city of Venice, issued as a woodcut in 1500. But then, late fifteenth century Venice still was a small space compared with the stretch of Nagasaki Bay Keiga took as his subject. But it also has to be realized that Di Barbari's view of Venice, in much the same way as that of Amsterdam by Cornelis Anthoniszoon of 1538, both cities seen as if from the air, could well have been made by walking the streets and rendering the houses and buildings in an admittedly contrived projection - altogether in tune with the fascination of the times. In the case of Keiga's painting, there is probably nothing in the tradition of Japanese painting which might have helped him. This, admittedly leaves us with the riddle how exactly Keiga conceived this idea. Was it Jan Cock Blomhoff, the Captain of Deshima, the Dutch trading post, the commissioner of the painting? But even so, how could he possibly have explained to Keiga what exactly he wanted? Indeed, the painting raises many questions but cannot fail to convince us that this represents an unheard of accomplishment. Moreover, it is a painting which continues to attract our attention to ever new details, moreover a great pleasure to view and never revealing the secrets it has.\r\n\r\nThis painting is undoubtedly an explicit commission from Blomhoff to Keiga.\r\n\r\nAdditional:\r\nJan Cock Blomhoff (1779-1853) acted as chief merchant, or Captain, of the Dutch settlement at Deshima, Nagasaki, Japan, from 1817 to 1823. He had earlier been employed at Deshima as the assistant of Captain Hendrik Doeff junior, was sent to England by Thomas Stamford Raffles in 1813 in the period of the Napoleonic Wars when Holland was part of France, and after his release appointed the successor of Doeff. In the meantime, Holland had become a Kingdom and the establishment of the Royal Cabinet of Curiosities at The Hague (in what is now the Mauritshuis) in 1816 was, for its Director, Reinier van der Kapellen, an instigation to form a comprehensive collection of objects which would serve to explain to the Dutch audience what Japanese culture was. In this sense, Jan Cock Blomhoff's collection is unique in that it is the earliest collection in the world history of museums where someone makes a collection with the explicit intention to elucidate to the inhabitants of one country what and why another culture is different and what it entails. \r\nJan Cock Blomhoff's collection was, after a few substantial donations to the Royal Cabinet, bought by King William I in 1826. (The catalogue of his collection which he prepared himself on that occasion is presently being edited and translated for publication.) Later, in 1883, when the Royal Cabinet was dissolved, the objects considered as of an ethnographic nature were moved to the in the meantime established National Museum of Ethnography at Leiden - as an independent successor to the Siebold Japanese Museum, though essentially a subsidiary housing of part of the Royal Cabinet collection - whereas those objects considered as 'art' went to the then newly established National Museum at Amsterdam.\r\n Cf objects from the Siebold Collection\r\n Cf objects from the Fisscher Collection\r\n\r\nThis description was given for the ASEMUSvirtual master pieces collection." .
