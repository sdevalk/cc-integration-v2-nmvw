There are the major rockhole sites of Tuwan and Kanmati two rockholes side by side. Wayara is another rock hole depicted here. All of this country has sand dunes through it and in the past people would walk all through this country.\r\n\r\nIn this painting Ian (kunmanara) has painted Tuwan, his place of birth and homeland. Tuwan is spoken of as a \"big area\" which indicates the Tjukurpa (creation story) is powerful and important. Tuwan is unusual within the immediate region, for it's substantial creek bed, although dry most of the year. It is said that the creek was formed by the presence and movement of a large python on its way through this country. This presence makes the place sacred and it is held in high esteem by the Spinifex people.\r\n\r\nKunmanara Pumani (1949-2019)\r\n\r\n\" src=\"blob:https://webmail.lycos.com/8ca89319-b32b-4cb6-9460-859b17d073af\" alt=\"KunmanaraNyupulyaPumani_Antara_2018_198x366cm_457-18.jpeg\" apple-inline=\"yes\" class=\"Apple-web-attachment Singleton\" style=\"opacity: 1;\">\r\n\r\nFrom the directors, artists and staff at Mimil Maku Arts:\r\n \r\nIt is with greatest sadness we write to inform you of the passing of one of Mimili Maku’s great Elders, Kunmanara (Ngupulya) Pumani.\r\n \r\nMrs Pumani was a cultural leader of remarkable strengths, beauty and compassion. She was one of the women without whom the art centre movement would not have become what it is today. She was a teacher, and leader, for Anangu and piranpa alike. Alongside her mother and sister, she created the very foundations on which Mimili Maku Arts continues to grow. As our chairperson for a great number of years, she radiated cultural authority deeply rooted in her family’s connection to the land upon which Mimili was built.\r\nMrs Pumani was an incredibly generous and empathic leader, who led from the heart, and always cared for others first. She grew up on Everard Park Station, where she worked for many years before the APY Land Rights Act in 1981. Alongside her sister, Kunmanara started the first pre-school in Indulkana and Mimili, worked at the Mimili Clinic and Mimili Anangu School, before deciding to share her knowledge and stories through art. Throughout her career she found ways to connect her passions of art, teaching and mentorship, working with school groups, leading bush trips for artists and kids, and developing a digital Yankunytjatjara language maintenance project.\r\nKunmanara’s presence commanded any room, demanding highest respect whilst at the same time creating an encouraging and safe space that allowed for the ongoing and necessary processes of cultural learning and understanding. She was generous and patient in the way she chose to share her knowledge. Until the end, Kunmanara carried herself in the profound knowledge that she was one of the great keepers of Tjukurpa for Mimili and Antara. She dedicated the last weeks of her life to the maintenance of cultural protocol, and teaching the next generation.\r\nKunmanara Pumani was a truly magnificient woman, and it is impossible to find the right words to describe the impression she left on all of us. We will miss you, but we will continue to celebrate your stories, and the cultural strengths and authority you always stood for.\r\n\r\nMunu nganana dreaming tjuṯa nintilpai, ka tjana nintilpai titji tjuṯa nintilpai, nyangatja Dreaming, nyura ngula aṯunymananma. Ngura nyangtja Dreaming pulka mulapa nyurampa: maḻatja maḻatja maḻatja maḻatja maḻatja nyrurampa – keep on going – mapitjantjaku.\r\nAnd we teach about Tjukurpa, and the children learn, later on into the future you will look after it and keep on looking after it. This place has a very big dreaming, your dreaming: and for generation, after generation, after generation, after generation, after generation it will be yours – it will keep on going – it will go out and onwards.  \r\n(Kunmanara Pumani, 2019)\r\n\r\n\r\ninfo@mimilimaku.com ｜0419 203 324｜ www.mimilimaku.com\r\nPMB 252 Mimili Community Via Alice Springs 0872 N.T. \r\n\r\n\" src=\"blob:https://webmail.lycos.com/8564cefc-cc14-4b67-845a-ee5dc896fb84\" alt=\"MIMIL_LOGO_3[75].png\" apple-inline=\"yes\" class=\"Apple-web-attachment Singleton\" style=\"opacity: 1;\">" .
