<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-362-119> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "362-119\r\nChemehuevi basketry bowl; sa-puht (Van Valkenburgh 1976:15); willow, devil's claw; h. 15 cm., d. 43 cm.; ca. 1870-1880.\r\n\tAlthough the Great Basin Numic peoples preferred leftward coiling, clockwise coiling was typical for the Chemehuevis. However, some exceptions have been noted by Kania who points out that the technique of rightward coiling was probably adopted from Californian neighbors. Although designs were almost exclusively executed in dark-brown from yucca roots to black devil's claw (Martynia proboscidea; Chemehuevi: oah-oon-oop), occasional use was made of the root of the Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia), resulting in red designs. Designs were also applied in paint on baskets (Mason 1904:518-519, plate 232; Kroeber 1925:597; Robinson 1954:144; Miller and Miller 1967:12; Van Valkenburg 1976:16; Kania 2006:69-70).\r\n\tThis basket is coiled clockwise, using a three-rod foundation. It exhibits a decorative brown pattern on the outside consisting of a solid center with diagonally meanders and triangles that has faded to the extent that is has become almost invisible. The basket is blackened throughout by use and age.\r\n\r\n362-118, 119, 191, 192 Chemehuevi basketry\r\n\tEarly documented collections of Chemehuevi basketry are at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County (the Ammann collection from 1898-1913; Kania 2007), the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC (acquired from the Fred Harvey Company in 1903; Mason 1904:518-519, plate 232), the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, PA (the George Wharton James collection, acquired in 1902), the Hearst Museum of Anthropology in Berkeley, CA (collected by Kroeber between 1904 and 1908), and the Field Museum in Chicago, IL (acquired by George Dorsey in 1904; Kania 2006:70). Thus, the specimens Ten Kate collected on the Fort Mohave Indian reservation in 1883 are probably the earliest documented Chemehuevi baskets.\r\n\tThe study of Chemehuevi basketry has been neglected by anthropologists. Singular observations on the craft are scattered throughout the literature, but do not provide a clear or coherent, let alone a complete picture (cf. Smith and Simpson 1964:15-32). Clara Lee Tanner (1983:216-225) provided the best initial study, based on an analysis of the large Birdie Brown collection at the Colorado River Indian Tribes Museum in Parker, Arizona, as well as many items from other museums and private collections. Santa Fe gallery owner John J. Kania must be credited with several subsequent studies of various collections (2006, 2007).\r\n\tThe four Chemehuevi baskets collected by Ten Kate fit the characterization of the tribal craft by Tanner. All are coiled clockwise, using a three-rod foundation, and have decorative designs. These were considered as the personal property of weavers and one did not infringe thereon. Although some authors have stated that the Chemehuevis only made coiled baskets, others have qualified that statement (Smith and Simpson 1964:16; Dalrymple 2000:57-67). Ten Kate witnessed twined conical burden baskets and winnowing trays as still being produced in 1883, types typical of traditional Numic basketry from the Great Basin. He was correct in assuming that the Chemehuevis traded their fine basketry with other Colorado River tribes. When the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1883, Chemehuevi basketmakers also produced ware for sale to travelers and tourists.\r\n\r\nColor photo\r\nChemehuevi basketmaker; postcard (RMV col. 5910-44)\r\n\r\n\r\nEen mand, in een spiraal met de klok mee gevlochten, een karakteristiek kenmerk van Chemehuevi vlechtwerk.
