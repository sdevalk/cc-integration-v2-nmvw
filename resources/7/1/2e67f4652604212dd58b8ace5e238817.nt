<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/R-4029a> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "BOBO was the leader of the Kipipiri 4. Once she did her hair, she would walk majestically and gracefully across the village without uttering a word. This was a message to the village women that at midnight they were going to visit the men deep in the forest. Her hair was twisted and curled in a complex design to form a route map to the caves that only her 2nd in command would interpret. Never did they get lost or caught." .
