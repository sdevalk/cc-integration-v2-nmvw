Slightly more than a decade before Ten Kate's visit, the Apaches penetrated into the Santa Rita Mountains near San Xavier del Bac. However, the Papagos resisted this movement by using fortifications of the prehistoric Hohokam inhabitants of the area, now called trincheras, from which they defended their territory and homes, as the anthropologist observed during an excursion through that area. Direct contact with the enemy was considered not only physically dangerous but also leading to contamination. In his fieldnotes Ten Kate recorded that both Papagos and Pimas who killed an Apache enemy had to undergo a purification ceremony during which warriors were kept in isolation from their communities for four days, and were fed by friends bringing food to them.\r\n\tThe head is this club is painted black on the side and red on the top, the colors of war. The long handle shows remains of red pigment. This club used to have a cotton strap (see illustration in Papago section at RMV 362-36). To ward off arrows and blows by clubs, the Papagos used rawhide shields, often with painted designs (cf. Russell 1908:96; Lumholtz 1912:110; Fontana 1983:142).\r\n(Hovens 2009)\r\n\r\nHouten krijgsknots aan katoenen lus." .
