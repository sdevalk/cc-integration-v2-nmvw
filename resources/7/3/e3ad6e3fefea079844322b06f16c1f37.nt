He included it in his collection of ethnographic artifacts because Indians were increasingly wearing citizen's dress. Many Indians owned cattle or worked for white ranchers, and turned to wearing cowboy outfits, including such riding pants used while driving cattle.\r\n(Hovens 2009)\r\n\r\nEen leren rijbroek, cowboyleggings." .
