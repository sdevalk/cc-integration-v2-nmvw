<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-02-1082> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "“Dharma sailing eastward” (da mo dong du tu 达摩东渡图)\r\n\r\nThe original inscription of this rubbing is also conserved in Xi’an Beilin. It was painted by a monk named “Feng Dian” of Qing Dynasty, then inscribed on the stele. In this painting, Dharma (abbreviation of Bodhidharma)  has the image of an Indian monk who is stubbly beard, carrying a shoe with a cane on the \r\nright shoulder, holding a rosary in the left hand, and stepping on reeds to cross the river. The painter depicts the image with gross lines so as to make the figure more expressive and vivid. The skill of the inscription is also terse and forceful. It’s a very lively figure painting in the ancient Chinese art history.\r\nAt the upper right corner of the rubbing, there are four verses written in “kai shu” (one of the calligraphic styles of Chinese characters), as follow: \r\n折苇江上客 (zhe wei jiang shang ke)\r\n西来东渡人 (xi lai dong du ren)\r\n大意人人有 (da yi ren ren you)\r\n空走徒劳心 (kong zou tu lao xin)\r\n\r\nThe meaning is : \r\nthe traveller on the river bends the reeds\r\nComing from the West is the one crossing towards the East\r\nEvery one knows the essence of truth\r\nWalking in vain is only to fatigue the heart \r\n\r\nAfter these verses, it is followed by four characters “直指人心(zhi zhi ren xin)”, which is a doctrine of Zen that means to reach the heart straight and directly. Then, the painting time and the name and seal of the painter are also seen by the left side. \r\n\r\nAbout the biography of the painter, monk “fengdian”, there is nearly no record in the Buddhist works or history works of Buddhist monuments. It could only be deduced according to the local records of his hometown Yongdeng in the province of Gansu. It’s obvious that his life was totally a tragedy.  The original name of the monk “Feng Dian” (Actually this Chinese word means “mad”, “crazy” or “mental disorder ”) was Li Fu. He was born in 165 , the 8th year of Emperor Shunzhi and got married at 14 years old. Just 4 years after his marriage, he discarded his wife, cut down his own fingers and converted into Buddhism. After having become a monk, he travelled around the country, helped those poor people and fought with the social evils along his trip. It was said that he was very good at painting the portrait of Dharma and always painted them after getting drunk. He also improvised short poems and recorded them on the paintings.\r\n     By the old Chinese way of counting the years in this painting, we could deduce that it was painted in 1689.\r\n(Jing Tan, 2008)" .
