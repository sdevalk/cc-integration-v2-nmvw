Suggestions include attachments to flutes, smoking pipe stems, prows of canoes, quivers, necklaces, and atlatl handles (cf. Townsend 1959). Consensus favors the idea that they were atlatl weights, but much speculation remains on how much, if any, mechanical advantage is derived from their use (Raymond 1986; Whitaker 2005).\r\n\r\nThis highly stylized specimen is made from grayish green-banded slate. It is a classic example of the oval popeyed type featuring a biconically-drilled hole at base of neck. The bird depicted exhibits a long gently upturned beak with slightly upswept doorknob shaped eyes on either side of the head. The base has a slight projection in front at right angles to the body to accommodate the perforation, and another immediately in front of a laterally compressed area separating the body from the poorly defined tail. The projections on the base are better defined in other reported specimens suggesting that, along with the hole, they were used to facilitate hafting. Similar specimens have been reported from New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa.\r\n\r\nHighly polished birdstones, and related bannerstones and boatstones, appear in Late Archaic through Early Woodland sequences in the Great Lakes region dating ca 2.000-600 B.C. They are part of widespread ground and polished stone tradition whose workmanship often goes well beyond that needed for a strictly utilitarian object. There seems little doubt that these objects were attached to the middle of atlatl handles and that they conveyed some functional advantage by resisting acceleration and storing energy (Baugh 2003). If properly matched with a flexible dart the result can be a smoother, more controlled, and more powerful launch. Many variables can affect test results, however, including the type, length, and flexibility of raw materials coupled with the skill level of the individual using the atlatl.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve beneficial results in spear throwing, atlatl weights do not have to be beautifully sculpted forms. Carefully selected minimally shaped river cobbles will serve the same purpose. Given the high level of workmanship exhibited in most specimens and their occasional appearance in burials it is likely that birdstones provided some added spiritual leverage. As with other forms of mimetic magic, the perfect stone may have helped to insure the perfect flight of the dart â€“ hence the bird metaphor. The widespread distribution of birdstones made from this rather uncommon type of banded slate suggests that the aesthetic principles behind the birdstone imagery were broadly shared.\r\n\r\nDuane Anderson\r\nMuseum of Indian Arts and Culture, Santa Fe, NM\r\n\r\nRichard A.
