A string of cane bugles 325 cm. long. The individual bugles are between 1.9 and 2.1 cm. long, and are strung on a fine cord of double twisted bark fibre cord.\r\nWithin thies category of Clothing and ornament we can cite only the cane bugle necklet.\r\n\r\nSuch necklaces are frequently recorded in the ethnohistorical sources for New South Wales, and examples from the central areas of the state and from Port Jackson are preserved in museum collections (for example those from Port Jackson in the Museum of Mankind and from Bathurst at Saffron Walden). However this example in the Leiden collection is the only cane necklace from the north coast, though the historical evidence attests to their use in that area. Flick (1934) mentions necklaces made both of shell and from lawyer vine canes. Miss Bundock (1898a:1) notes that strings of cane beads were worn by the men as belts, also 'worn coiled in many folds round their neck and hanging on the chest as a necklace and looked very well, contrasting as it did with the dark skins of the wearers'. The men also wore shell pendants, and necklets made from dogs' teeth and coloured beans; the shells were obtained by exchange with the groups living on the coast (ibid:2)." .
