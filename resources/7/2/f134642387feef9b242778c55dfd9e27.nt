Blankets and garments were also produced for Spanish settlers, partially as compulsory tribute, partially in interethnic trade. Embroidery was introduced, and prehistoric designs were thus applied to new textiles, especially on borders. Red commercial cloth was raveled for re-use, and from Mexico indigo became available. When the Americans took control of the Southwest in 1848, they encountered a strong Puebloan textile tradition that had incorporated Spanish elements. The Hopis were the most productive weavers and traded their textiles with the Zunis and the Rio Grande Pueblos. Typical woven Pueblo items of dress included mantas (shoulder and dress blankets), shawls, shirts, kilts, belts, sashes, breechcloths, leggings, garters, and headbands. Decorative designs were applied by embroidery and brocading. From the 1870s the trade on the Santa Fe Trail began to furnish commercial cloth, and soon the Puebloan weaving tradition waned (Jeancon and Douglas 1930; Douglas 1939, 1939a, 1940, 1940a).\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)\r\n\r\nHalssnoer met zakjes waarin verfstof om gezicht te beschilde- ren." .
