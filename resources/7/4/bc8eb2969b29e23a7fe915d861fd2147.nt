His grandmother (centre) ruled in his stead as regent until he turned 21. From 1899 until 1906, when Swaziland became a British protectorate, Gwamile was the last independent ruler in Southern Africa. \r\n\r\nSobhuza II ruled as Paramount Chief and later King after Swaziland (now Eswatini) became independent from the British Empire in 1968. His reign, starting in 1899 and ending on his death in 1982 is the longest confirmed reign of any monarch in history." .
