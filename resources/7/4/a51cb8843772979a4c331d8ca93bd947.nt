They are wearing headdresses, neck ornaments, have fresh leaves in their armbands and the man on the left is carrying a pig. As with all photos, there is more to the story than the image one sees. The negative for this one came to the museum from the collection of a man (Dr. Jan Arie Van der Hoeven 1912-1998) who was interested in eugenics and ‘racial hygiene’ and even joined the SS during World War II. After the war he opted to work as a government doctor in New Guinea, rather than serve six years in prison. The collections he made during this time included human remains. -E. Lilje" .
