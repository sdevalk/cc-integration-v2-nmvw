<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1403-2465> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Thin statue of a standing Buddha, very worn. Details are difficult to see. The left shoulder may be covered by a monk’s robe, while the right shoulder is probably bare. The robe clings to the body, and bunches near the figure’s ankles. The robe on the right side is attached to the figure’s arm, so possibly he is holding the hem of his robe in his left hand, as in other statues. The cranial protuberance (ushnisha) is barely visible, and the facial features have been worn away. The two arms are held in front of the body, and seem to be held in a position suggesting abhaya mudra (showing absence of fear). The back of the statue is flat, and the figure stands on a lotus base. Because the statue is so worn, it is difficult to identify this figure as a specific Buddha." .
