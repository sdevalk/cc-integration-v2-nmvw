Their creation, involving the preparation and weaving of many hundreds of threads, entailed complex technical, ritual and customary understandings. Cloaks often highly important gifts and heirlooms, exemplified ancestral mana, spiritual power.\r\n\r\nOf thousands of historic cloaks now distributed across museums in New Zealand and in many other countries, this one of those first acquired by Europeans; it was obtained by participants in Captain Cook's first voyage, which circumnavigated both the North and South Islands of New Zealand in 1969 and 1770. It is an exceptionally wide cloak, of a type that would have been wrapped around the front of the body, under the arms, and then crossed over the shoulders and secured at the front. The fabric is soft, light  and pliable; it bears an panel of elegant taniko design, made up of threads dyed a dark purple-red, possibly from tanekaha bark. Its tribal or regional origin within New Zealand is not known, but it was doubtless a garment of exceptionally high value. It must have been presented, a deliberate and significant gift to a senior member of  the expedition such as Cook himself, Joseph Banks or Tupaia, who was perceived by many Maori as leader of the visiting mariners.\r\n\r\n(Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts p. 297)\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand, the Maori used fibres of a native flax which were weft-twined (the loom was not used in Polynesia) into cloaks that combined warmth with prestige. Flax cloaks with special borders (taniko) incorporated designs by intertwining elements of different colours. \r\n(Kaeppler A.L., The Pacific Arts of Polynesia and Micronesia, Oxford University Press, 2008, p.12)" .
