<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/1516f9e2eee819ffa2c27fcaa5404643> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Zoals alles in de Yolngu wereld verdeeld is in Yirritja en Dhuwa, is het ook verdeeld in zoetwater en zoutwater clans. Het Gupapnyngu volk is een zoetwater volk en behoort tot de eucalyputus bossen. De wezens die hen gecreëerd hebben heten Barama en Laindjang. Hun verhalen gaan over vuur, honing, de duikeend, de aalstaartige zeewolf en de grafpaal die Djalunbu heet. \n\nBarama stuurde Laindjang naar het westen, maar hij overtrad bepaalde wetten en Barama beval zijn dood. Toen hield hij een ceremonie voor Laindjang, waarbij het vuur uitbrak en de hele ceremoniële grond in de as legde. Toen het vuur zich over de open velden verspreidde, dreef het de buideldassen, kwartels, hagedissen en bijen voor zich uit. De krokodillenman brandde zich aan het vuur en dook in het water om de pijn van zijn wonden te verzachten.\n\nHelpers van Laindjang maakten de eerste holle boomstam ceremonie en de duikeend totem. Toen ze ermee klaar waren, hadden ze hun lichamen beschilderd met het zeewolf-motief en gooiden de boomstam in het heilige meer, waar het naar de diepste plaats zakte. De jonge aalstaartige zeewolfjes zijn doorzichtig, waardoor hun ruggegraat duidelijk te zien is. Dit is een motief dat vaak geschilderd wordt. In het echt bewonen deze visjes boomstammen die in het water gevallen zijn. De jonge aalstaartige zeewolfjes worden gezien als de zielen van de doden en de ongeborenen. De boomstammen worden beschouwd als de lichamen van de overledenen of als een soort spirituele reservoirs.\r\n\r\nJust as everything in the Aboriginal world is divided into Yirritja and Dhuwa, it is also divided in into freshwater people and saltwater people. The Gupapnyngu people are freswater people and belong to the eucalyputus forests. Their creative beings are called Barama and Laindjang. Their stories are of fire, honey, and the diver duck and the Eel tail catfish, and the Bone Coffin called Djalunbu.\r\n\r\nBarana sent Laindjang westward but they broke special laws and Barama ordered his death. He then held a ceremony of Laindjang at which a fire broke out and burnt the whole ceremonial ground. As the fire broke out across the open plains it forced the bandicoot, quails, goanna and bees to flee before it. The crocodile man was burnt by the fire and dived into the water to soothe his wounds.\r\n\r\nAssistants of Laindjang made the first hollow log ceremony and Diver Duck totem. When they finished they had painted their bodies with the catfish design and threw the log into the sacred well where it sank into the deepest part. The baby eeltail catfish are translucent making the herringbone pattern clearly visible. In real life these fish inhabit fallen logs of in water courses. The baby catfish are thought of as the souls of the deceased and unborn. The poles - the bodies of deceased persons reinvested with their soul or as spiritual reservoirs.\r\n\r\nOther groups of freshwater people such as the Waluki people of Gatji Lagoon and the Balambi people of Yathalamarra.\r\n\r\nGURRMIRRINGU STORY\r\nGurrmirringu can be used to mean the first people of Manharrngu people and a particular spirit; a powerful hunter, law giver and warrior. He travelled all over Ngorrunyuwa and Mulanga (Eastern bank of t5he Glyde River) hunting and collecting. Looking to the north he could see smoke from from fires on the shore Crocodile islands and threw a spear which turned into rock just off the mouth of the River. Sometimes it is said that the rock is Gurrmirringu himself. One story says that he was killed by the bite of a King Brown Snake, the Death Addar, the nut from the Sage rush, the White berry bush and yams that he collected.\r\nIn the 1960's a painting of Gurrmirringu lying 'in state' used to adorn the reverse side of the Australian one dollar note.\r\n\r\nRAMINGINING\r\nRamingining is a small community of around 590 people, of whom about 30 are non-Aboriginal people, mostly advisors or teacherrs of some sort or another. The village itself is located some 400 kms to the east of Darwin, and nearly 30 kms from the Arafura Sea. It is a relatively new settlement, having only been established in the early 1970's. \r\n\r\nEarlier, in the 1960's an outstation of Milingimbi was set up at Nangalalala [ 8 kms N/E of Ramingining], a kilometre or so from the Glyde River. Ther older settlement Milingimbi Mission, was established in 1926 and is in fact situated on an island a few kilometres off the north Australia coastline. Nangala is still in existence, and is now considered an outstation of Ramingining.\r\nThe area around Ramingining on the mainland is home for the Djinang speaking Wurrkigenydjarr/Marrangu, Wulaki, Mildjingi, Balmbi and Murrungun clans.  In a wider circle are the Burarra, Rembarrnga, Wudamin, Ganalbingu and Manharrngu peoples. To the north are the Gorryindi, Gamalangga, Malarra and Walamangu peoples who look after the Crocodile Islands. Other people who live there and have ceremonial connections are members of the Gupapuyngu, Djambarrpuyngu, Wagilag, Liyagalawumir and Liya-gawumirr groups.  \r\nThe particular tract of land upon which Ramingining township is built is owned by the Djadawitjibi people, of the Djiang group. Their principal creative being is Garrtjambal, the kangaroo.\r\nSome 10-20 kms to the south of the village of Ramingining, where the looping Glyde River becomes the Goyder, is the large Arafura Swamp. Some 250 sq kms in area, this unique fresh water environment is home for an innumerable variety of water birds (including gurramatji, the magpie goose), fresh water plants, fields of water lilies, crocodiles, water snakes, insect life, and the magnificent and rare Corypha elata palm. (hundred year palm?).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBARKPAINTING, ARNHEMLAND\r\n\r\nThe first barkpaintings  probably were on the inside of rain shelters. Lengths of Eucalyptus  bark were attached with their smooth insides to simple frames of branches. People then would decorate the bark during periods of forced idleness. 19th century explorers reported that barkpaintings were an important factor in rituals and ceremonies. Today this is still the case in Arnhem Land. The choice and treatment of subjects was limited by cultural and religious traditions. Some of the paintings could only be exposed.\r\n\r\nThe wet season is the best time to harvest the bark because it is flexible then and easy to remove. With a sharp axe two rings are cut into the trunk. These are subsequently connected wioth a vertical cut. As the bark is flexible and damp it is easy to peel off. The loose bark on the outside is chopped away. Subsequently, the remaining bark s put on a steady burning fire face down. Because of the heat the bark flattens and the moisture evaporates. Weighed down with stones the bark is left for a few days. Later, to keep the bark from warping sometimes sticks are attached to the top and the bottom.\r\n\r\nArnhem Land artists only rarely use other colours than the basic red, yellow, black and white. The red and yellow derive from the ochres that are found in the ochre pits. Black stems from charcoal. White is made from plaster or pipe clay. The material is finely ground and mixed with water, added with a binder. The simple throw-away brushes are made of bark fibres, human hair, chewed twigs and thin shoots.\r\nPortrayed are subjects related to daily life. On the coast, for example the hunting of kangaroos, fresh water crocodiles and birds. Other images have to do with personal totem stories and Dreamtime histories.\r\n\r\nWithin Arnhem Land art there are distinct regional styles. The famous x-ray style is mostly found in the western part. Not only the outside of a human being, animal or spirit is painted, but als important organs and the spine. These paintings often have a plain background and one or two figures, one of them being a Mimi spirit. The most important parts of the work are covered with cross lines. These patterns are individual, every artist having his own pattern.\r\nWhen we look at the choice of subject and technique, there is a strong resemblance to the old rockpaintings in the area. The art in the northern and eastern part of Arnhem Land is more colourful and intricate. Often the, the whole bark is covered with figures and abstract, geometric patterns. Frequently, there is a border around the painting and the work is divided into segments representing different stories. \r\nIn central Arnhem Land there is more an exchange between the different groups. Art here is open to change. The composition is more important than the intricate attention to details and thus acquires greater vitality." .
