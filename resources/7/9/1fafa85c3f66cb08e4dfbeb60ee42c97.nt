At night, it emerged from the sea glowing, prophesying about a bountiful harvest and plague. It resembles a mermaid, but the mouth is beak-shaped, covered with scales from the neck down, and has three legs. He is said to have said, \"If there is going to be an epidemic, show people the picture of me as soon as possible.\"\r\nThe ‘epidemic announcing’ creature Amabie was relatively unknown, but recently became an internet hit (‘went viral’, so to speak). It is now regarded as giving additional protection against the new corona virus. As such, Amabie quickly became part of the pantheon of cute figures in Japanese popular culture, and currently features on various products and documents associated with the corona virus pandemic, one of which is this embroidered non-medical face mask by KYO-TO-TO." .
