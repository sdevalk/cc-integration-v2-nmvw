De spiegel is versierd met het \"vogel-fabeldier-druiven\" decor, [ luanshou-putao ],  dat in de Tang en Song periode populair was.\r\nDe oorspronkelijk spiegelende zijde was glad gepolijst, terwijl de achterzijde met reliëfvoorstellingen is gedecoreerd. Centraal op de achterzijde bevindt zich een knop in de vorm een dierfiguur met daarin een gat. Hierdoor kon het koord voor het vasthouden van de spiegel worden gehaald. Ook was het hierdoor mogelijk de spiegel op een stok te steken en aldus op te houden.\r\nRondom de knop zijn binnen drie cirkels van uiteenlopende breedte dier- en druivenplantdecoraties aangebracht.\r\nHoewel druiven en druivenplanten al vele eeuwen eerder op Chinese bronzen spiegels werden aangebracht, menen sommigen in de druiven(plant)decoratie, in combinatie met de afbeeldingen van de (gevleugelde) dieren, de invloed van de Manicheërs te zien. Voor hen waren druiven heilig voedsel, (gevleugelde) hemelse paarden symbolseerden het licht, leeuwen de zon en vogels vreugde en een gelukkig huwelijk.\r\n\r\nBronze mirrors were an important part of the personal accoutrements of those of higher rank from very early times, and in fact a small mirror was even discovered in a Qijia culture tomb dating to around 2000 B.C.. The great age of Chinese bronze mirrors, however, lasted from the Late Warring States period to the end of the Tang. The \"lion and grapevine\" pattern mirror is very characteristic of the Tang dynasty and is rich in the kind of Middle Eastern influence which came to China through the Silk Road. This example is crisply cast with two principal fields, an outer one in which running \"lions\" chase after pairs of different kinds of birds, and an inner one in which six \"lions\" gambol around a seventh forming the central knop. It is interesting that one of the \"lions\" is clearly in a state of sexual excitement - reminiscent of the satyrs of the classical world.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the finest Sui and Tang bronze mirrors were made at Yangzhou on the Grand Canal. Decoration, cast in high relief or repoussé, includes auspicious motifs, Taoist scenes, and the 12 zodiacal animals. The \"lion and grape\" mirror was very popular in the 7th and 8th centuries, for it embodied both Chinese directional and \"five phases\" symbolism, and lions and grapes were also potent symbols in the Manichaean faith introduced by the Uighur from Central Asia. This type of mirror disappeared abruptly with the persecution of the Manichaeans in 843.\r\n\r\nManichaeism is a dualistic religious movement founded in Persia in the 3rd century AD by Mani, who was known as the \"Apostle of Light\" and supreme \"Illuminator.\" Although Manichaeism was long considered a Christian heresy, it was a religion in its own right that, because of the coherence of its doctrines and the rigidness of its structure and institutions, preserved throughout its history a unity and unique character.\r\n\r\nMani was born in southern Babylonia (now in Iraq). With his \"annunciation\" at the age of 24, he obeyed a heavenly order to manifest himself publicly and to proclaim his doctrines; thus began the new religion. From that point on, Mani preached throughout the Persian Empire. At first unhindered, he later was opposed by the king, condemned, and imprisoned. After 26 days of trials, which his followers called the \"Passion of the Illuminator\" or Mani's \"crucifixion,\" Mani delivered a final message to his disciples and died (sometime between 274 and 277).\r\n\r\nMani viewed himself as the final successor in a long line of prophets, beginning with Adam and including Buddha, Zoroaster, and Jesus. He viewed earlier revelations of the true religion as being limited in effectiveness because they were local, taught in one language to one people. Moreover, later adherents lost sight of the original truth. Mani regarded himself as the carrier of a universal message destined to replace all other religions. Hoping to avoid corruption and to ensure doctrinal unity, he recorded his teachings in writing and gave those writings canonical status during his lifetime.\r\n\r\nThe Manichaean Church from the beginning was dedicated to vigorous missionary activity in an attempt to convert the world. Mani encouraged the translation of his writings into other languages and organized an extensive mission program. Manichaeism rapidly spread west into the Roman Empire. From Egypt it moved across northern Africa (where the young Augustine temporarily became a convert) and reached Rome in the early 4th century. The 4th century marked the height of Manichaean expansion in the West, with churches established in southern Gaul and Spain. Vigorously attacked by both the Christian Church and the Roman state, it disappeared almost entirely from Western Europe by the end of the 5th century, and, during the course of the 6th century, from the eastern portion of the Empire.\r\n\r\nDuring the lifetime of Mani, Manichaeism spread to the eastern provinces of the Persian Sasanian Empire. Within Persia itself, the Manichaean community maintained itself in spite of severe persecutions, until Muslim 'Abbasid persecution in the 10th century forced the transfer of the seat of the Manichaean leader to Samarkand (now in Uzbekistan).\r\n\r\nThe religion's expansion to the East had already begun in the 7th century with the reopening of caravan routes there after China's conquest of East Turkistan. A Manichaean missionary reached the Chinese court in 694, and in 732 an edict gave the religion freedom of worship in China. When East Turkistan was conquered in the 8th century by the Uighur Turks, one of their leaders adopted Manichaeism and it remained the state religion of the Uighur kingdom until its overthrow in 840. Manichaeism itself probably survived in East Turkistan until the Mongol invasion in the 13th century. In China it was forbidden in 843, but, although persecuted, it continued there at least until the 14th century.\r\n\r\nTeachings similar to Manichaeism resurfaced during the Middle Ages in Europe in the so-called neo-Manichaean sects. Groups such as the Paulicians (Armenia, 7th century), the Bogomilists (Bulgaria, 10th century), and the Cathari or Albigensians (southern France, 12th century) bore strong resemblances to Manichaeism and probably were influenced by it. However, their direct historical links to the religion of Mani are difficult to establish.\r\n\r\nMani sought to found a truly ecumenical and universal religion that would integrate into itself all the partial truths of previous revelations, especially those of Zoroaster, Buddha, and Jesus. However, beyond mere syncretism, it sought the proclamation of a truth that could be translated into diverse forms in accordance with the different cultures into which it spread. Thus, Manichaeism, depending on the context, resembles Iranian and Indian religions, Christianity, Buddhism, and Taoism.\r\n\r\nAt its core, Manichaeism was a type of Gnosticism--a dualistic religion that offered salvation through special knowledge (gnosis) of spiritual truth. Like all forms of Gnosticism, Manichaeism taught that life in this world is unbearably painful and radically evil. Inner illumination or gnosis reveals that the soul which shares in the nature of God has fallen into the evil world of matter and must be saved by means of the spirit or intelligence (nous). To know one's self is to recover one's true self, which was previously clouded by ignorance and lack of self-consciousness because of its mingling with the body and with matter. In Manichaeism, to know one's self is to see one's soul as sharing in the very nature of God and as coming from a transcendent world. Knowledge enables a person to realize that, despite his abject present condition in the material world, he does not cease to remain united to the transcendent world by eternal and immanent bonds with it. Thus, knowledge is the only way to salvation.\r\n\r\nThe saving knowledge of the true nature and destiny of humanity, God, and the universe is expressed in Manichaeism in a complex mythology. Whatever its details, the essential theme of this mythology remains constant: the soul is fallen, entangled with evil matter, and then liberated by the spirit or nous. The myth unfolds in three stages: a past period in which there was a separation of the two radically opposed substances--Spirit and Matter, Good and Evil, Light and Darkness; a middle period (corresponding to the present) during which the two substances are mixed; and a future period in which the original duality will be reestablished. At death the soul of the righteous person returns to Paradise. The soul of the person who persisted in things of the flesh--fornication, procreation, possessions, cultivation, harvesting, eating of meat, drinking of wine--is condemned to rebirth in a succession of bodies.\r\n\r\nOnly a portion of the faithful followed the strict ascetic life advocated in Manichaeism. The community was divided into the elect, who felt able to embrace a rigorous rule, and the hearers who supported the elect with works and alms.\r\n\r\nThe essentials of the Manichaean sacramental rites were prayers, almsgiving, and fasting. Confession and the singing of hymns were also important in their communal life. The Manichaean scriptural canon includes seven works attributed to Mani, written originally in Syriac. Lost after Manichaeism became extinct in the Middle Ages, portions of the Manichaean scriptures were rediscovered in the 20th century, mainly in Chinese Turkistan and Egypt.\r\n\r\n(uit de Encyclopedia Britannica)\r\n \r\n\r\nMo-ni Jiao is a little know Chinese religion which came in from the West. Literally, the name means the teachings of Mo-ni. The original writings of this religion were written in Syriac in the third century AD, except for one, which was written in Middle Persian. The original Syriac-Aramaic writings dealt with Jewish concepts, portraying Jesus, or Jesus the Messiah, as the person who awakens Adam and Eve to the source of the light within them, and tries to keep them from following the will of the evil Jewish god of greed and having children. But even in the first Persian writings, the religion of Mo-ni was already being adapted to the Zoroastrian religion, and the evil god of creation in the book of Genesis becomes identified with the Zoroastrian god of greed, Az, and further with Ahriman, the devil himself.\r\n\r\nThe god of light, revealed by Jesus to Adam and Eve, becomes identified with the Zoroastrian god of light, Ohrmazd. But as the religion of Mo-ni spread further east and entered into China, the religion reached its culmination and final, complete form. There, the beings of the religion, translated into Chinese, became identified with deities of Chinese Buddhism, such as Guan Yin. Whereas today there only exist fragments of the original Syriac and Persian writings, in Chinese there exist three complete writings of the religion of Mo-ni, called the Religion of Light, in China. The earlier Syriac and Persian sources are not forgotten, and there are transcribed in Chinese characters, also a few hymns from the original Syriac and Persian. There also exists in southern China, in the Fujian province, a temple with a statue which has an inscription on it to Mo-ni, the Buddha of Light.\r\n\r\n(From: jhoward@clark.net (Jim Howard)" .
