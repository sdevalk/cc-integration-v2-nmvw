The rain-supplication ritual is one of the most ancient and important gut (shaman rituals). Mudang dance in front of a Rain Dragon painting and make animal-blood offerings to the Rain Spirit personified by the dragon. Mudang rain holes, cuplike depressions carved in boulders, were meant to receive these offerings and are found throughtout Korea. \r\nThe dragon is the best-known and perhaps the most ancient mythical creature in the Far East. Like most of the other imaginary animals in Chinese mythology, the dragon is of Taoist origin. Dragons decorate the surfaces of bronze ritual vessels from the Shang (1523-1028 B.C.) and Chou (1027-256 B.C.) dynasties, often in conjunction with the Thunder Pattern, a squared-spiral design derived from ancient pictographs for clouds, lightning, and thunder. Chinese depictions of dragons reached their full, familiar form during the Han Dynasty (206 B.C. - A.D. 221) ; they were transmitted to Korea through the Han trading colony at Lo-lang (108 B.C. -A.D.313). Han trading colony at Lo-lang. (108 B.C. - A.D.313) Although Taoist in origin, the dragon became associated with all four Korean religions: Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, and Shamanism. \r\nThe Far Eastern dragon is awesome but benevolent, unlike the Western dragon. In Korea a dream about a dragon is the most auspicious of dreams: If a man deams of a dragon, he will achieve success; if a woman dreams of a dragon, she will bear a son who wil be a virtuous man. \r\nThe dragon is a water spirit who controls oceans, rivers, lakes, rain, and floods. He lives in the Dragon Palace at the bottom of the sea or among the clouds in the sky. When a rainstorm occurs, it is because a dragon is ascending to the sky. He sometimes takes human form as The Dragon King, who is also called The Water Spirit or the Dragon Spirit, depicted as an riding a dragon. The Dragon King and the Mountain Spirit are sometimes paired in Shamanist paintings that symbolize their dominion over mountains and seas. The tiger is the messenger of The Mountain Spirit. Similarly, the tortoise is the messenger of the dragon and communicates between the Dragon Palace at the bottom of the sea and mortals on land. The tiger and the dragon, the two most powerful spirit animals, are often paired in pujok, paper talismans pasted on the doors or   walls of Korean houses to ward off evil spirits. \r\nThe dragon is frequently shown pursuing, or clutching in one of his front claws, the Flaming Pearl (a magic jewel from the sea symbolising wisdom and immortality). Immortality was primarily a Taoist consideration; wisdom was more of a Confucian theme. In a Confucian context, the dragon came to symbolise Heaven, as well as the virtue and authority of a king. As a royal symbol, the dragon was often painted yellow; as a rain symbol, he was usually painted blue. They were a predominant theme in the architectural decoration and ritual paraphernalia of Korean royal palaces and Confucian temples. A five clawed dragon in China or Korea was usually, but not always, restricted to royal use. Other depictions of dragons showed only four claws, or even three on each foot. A scroll painting of a dragon was often hung in a man's study to suggest his role as a virtuous head of the household." .
