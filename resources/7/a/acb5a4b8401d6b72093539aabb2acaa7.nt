<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/97b29dd8dfed5bf0e8e7da4990daf26d> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This is a copy of an engraving by Jan Sadeler (1550-1600) after Dirck Barendsz (1534-1592), who both worked in Antwerp. Here 'The Winter' was depicted in a series of the four seasons. The original engraving still showed cheeses and barrels as winter stock and a winter landscape further clarified the idea of winter. European engravings have been copied since Akbar's reign. 'The Winter' was already copied in the Gulshan album of the great Mughal Jahangir (1605-1628). This copy was made most likely for a Dutch patron in the 18th century when Indian paintings were popular in the Netherlands." .
