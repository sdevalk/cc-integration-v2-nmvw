The live images and harrowing photography elicited a massive and emotional anti-war movement within America itself. Many artists such as Tomi Ungerer expressed their outrage through the potent medium of posters. The German-born Ungerer, who lived in America between 1956 and 1970, is famous for his acerbic and iconoclastic visual commentaries. This poster makes its impact in a starkly satiric style. His use of the Statue of Liberty subverts a popular symbol of American freedom and has overtones of violation." .
