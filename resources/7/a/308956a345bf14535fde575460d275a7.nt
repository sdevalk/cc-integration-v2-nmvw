<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/WM-67276> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The figures on this pencil box come from the cartoon film da nao tiangong 大鬧天宮 (Havoc in Heaven), which was produced in 1961 – 1964. This pencil box presents the scene in which Sun Wukong 孫悟空 (the monkey king) is fighting the god Nezha 哪吒 (the third lotus prince). The story comes from the classic sixteenth-century novel Xiyou Ji 西遊記 (A Journey to the West), which narrates Buddhist monk Tang Sanzang’s 唐三藏legendary pilgrimage to the “Western Regions” (India) in order to obtain Buddhist sacred texts, along with his three disciples whom he subdued along the way. The three disciples were, according to the heaven standards, rebellious, greedy and evil. Tang Sanzang, being their shifu 师父 (master), carried the responsibility to convert them to goodness. Together they face 81 challenges and finally acquire the sacred texts, whereafter they are rewarded with important positions in Heaven. The novel included numerous characters and philosophical statements from Buddhism and Taoism, as well as metaphors referring to politics and social issues.\r\nBecause of the Cultural Revolution, the release of the full movie was postponed to 1978, whereafter it immediately became immensely popular. The film was produced by Shanghai dianying meishu zhipianchang 上海電影美術製片廠（Shanghai Animation Film Studio, which is one of the oldest Chinese animation film studios. Many classic animated films were produced here.  \r\n\r\nHannah Li, April 2019" .
