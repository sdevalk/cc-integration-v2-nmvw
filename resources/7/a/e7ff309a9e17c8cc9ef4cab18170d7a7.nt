<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-M6-4> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "A seventeenth century ivory figure from Owo (?) \r\nin the National Museum of Ethnology at Leiden\r\nR.M.A. Bedaux and J. Smits\r\nIn 1680, Johannes Braun (1628-1708) was appointed professor of Theology and Hebrew at Groningen University. Under the title of 'Selecta Sacra', in 1700, he published a selection of his theological studies among which an extensive treatise 'De planctu ob Tham­muz', about the mourning of Tammuz, which he considered as the personification of the patriarch Joseph. In this treatise he developed the thesis that the Hebrew Tammuz could be equated with the Egyptian Osiris, who's wife and sister Isis was sometimes depicted with a bushel, massive breasts and suckling her son Horus (Smits 1988). He therefore identified a Yoruba-like ivory statue of a kneeling woman with massive breasts and a bushel on her head as that of the goddess Isis. The description of the figure is accompanied by an excellent engraving depicting the figure seen from the front, back and side. Johannes Braun commented: \"Here in Groningen, in the office of the West India Company, is a figure made of shining white ivory, about 29 cm high and 39 cm in circumference, from Africa, not sculptured with great skill but by an uncivilised hand, as it usually happens among those peoples. It has probably a bushel on the head, supported with both hands, and has massive pendulous breasts and the neck, chest and arms are decorated with pearls, similar to those of a queen or goddess. I am practically certain that she represents the queen Isis Mammata of the Ancients. Hence, it may be assumed that the cult of that goddess has been accepted by these uncivilised peoples\". \r\nBraun further thanked the Chamber of the Dutch West India Company in Groningen for permission to include a picture of their figure in his publication. The West India Company, founded in 1621, traded with the Gold and Slave Coast in gold, ivory, wood, pepper, hides and slaves. Direct Dutch trade contacts with the inland territories of the Yoruba in Western Nigeria, from where the statue supposedly originates, were impossible since the lagoon coast was almost impenetrable. There were, however, frequent commercial contacts with Benin (Ryder 1969). The Benin rulers had little control of the lower course of the Benin river and the West India Company took advantage of this opportunity. Around the middle of the seventeenth century, the Company even ran a modest factory at Arbo, to which merchandise was brought from far inland. At the same time, there was some trading with the little coastal village of Ardra, near Cotonou, which maintained contacts with the Yoruba. It may well be assumed that the figure of 'Isis Mammata' was obtained by one of the Company's merchants or skippers in the course of the seventeenth century through one of these channels.\r\nThe figure was not mentioned in the inventory of the possessions of the West India Company, drawn up in 1795, four years after the Company's liquidation. Had it got lost somewhere in the eighteenth century or had it been taken away by one of the administrators? Any hope of finding the figure seemed to be in vain. And yet, by sheer chance, it was recently rediscovered when one of the authors (J.S.) visited the library of the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden and asked the curator of the Department Africa South of the Sahara (R.B.) whether he knew of any statues similar to the one depicted in Braun's book. It turned out that the statue had been in the collection of the Museum, since 1903, inventoried as number 1415-1. Dr. J.D.E. Schmeltz, the director of the Museum at that time, purchased the figure from J.G. Roering Warmolts (1867-1949), manager of a bakery in Groningen. Nothing was and is known about previous owners. Schmeltz held that the figure came from the Congo-region, that it was of a relatively recent date and had been carved after a European model (National Archives at The Hague: letters RMV 43 and 213). Pictures of the figure have been published by Visser (1938: Pl. 10), Tardy (1972: Pl. 401-1) and Duchâteau (1990: Pl. 112). \r\nThe statue is made in a style formerly attributed to the Yoruba or the Edo, and labelled Owo by Fagg (1951). Although this style has much in common with both Ife and Benin, it is said to show some distinctive characteristics of its own, such as vitality and vigour, flame-shaped scarifications on the torso, facial features ('Yoruba mouth'), and hair carved in relief as a kind of cap (Bassani and Fagg 1988: 191). Iconographical peculiarities, such as the snake-wing bird and the mudfish-legged figure grasping his legs with his hands, are also taken to be typical for Owo (Fraser 1975). Ancient works of art positively documented to have been made in this Yoruba kingdom are scarce and dates affixed to them, are generally highly speculative, as they are based implicitly on the generally conjectural dates for the Benin ivories. For the Bini-Portuguese ivories (Bassani and Fagg 1988) the situation is somewhat better. Some objects are securely dated, though any indication of their provenance is lacking. This is the case, for example, with some ivory bracelets preserved in the National Museum of Denmark, which were acquired in 1689 and collected probably prior to 1674 (Fraser 1975: Pl. 12 and 13; Gillon 1986: Pl. 150) and with ivory bracelets collected before 1656 (Weickmann collection), kept in the Ulm Museum (Fagg 1982: Fig.28). An ivory saltcellar in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna is mentioned in an inventory of the Obizzi collection (Padua) in 1806 (Bassani and Fagg 1988: Pl. 261). \r\nOnly the archaeological excavations in Owo (Eyo 1976; Eyo and Willett 1980) yielded objects of known dates and provenance. The earthenware statues from Igbo'Laja were made in a style reminiscent of both the Benin and Ife ones. These can be dated to the fourteenth-fifteenth centuries. \r\nFrom identified find-spot, there are some objects found during the British Punitive Expedition from 1897 in Benin. However, dates for these objects, which are now regarded as originating from Owo, remain conjectural. Frequent contacts between Benin and Owo are supported by oral traditions (Poynor 1976 and 1989; Abodiun 1989). For example, as early as the fifteenth century, Benin claims to have exercised military control over Owo. The Owo Olowo Oshogboye (16th century) is said to have been trained in the court of the Oba at Benin and Olowo Elewnokun (18th century) is said to have introduced many Benin court institutions in Owo. The famous Owo ivory carvers would have worked for the Oba of Benin. \r\n Five statues comparable to the Leiden one are recorded (Fagg 1963: Pl. 99, British Museum; Entwistle 1977: backcover, private collection in London and Toledo Museum of Art; Gillon 1988: Pl. 151, private collection in Los Angeles; Bassani and Fagg 1988: Pl.264, Pitt Rivers Museum). All these statues represent kneeling women, with only the statue from a London private collection having a bowl on the head. However, not much is recorded about the provenance and dates for these statues.\r\nAs may have become apparent from the above, it remains hazardous to assign a provenance to so-called Owo art. Much more systematic research is required to define the boundaries between Yoruba, Owo, Benin, Ife and, eventually, other still unidentified styles, if clear boundaries ever existed at all. In comparing the different styles, diachronic changes have to be taken into account as well.  \r\nUnlike the sixteenth century Bini-Portuguese saltcellars, 'oliphants' and spoons (Bassani and Fagg 1988), which were made specifically for the export to Europe and often decorated after contemporary European engravings, the Leiden statue was obviously made for local use. Although it is dangerous to assume a direct relation between the use of present-day objects and those more than three centuries old, one is inclined to see in the Leiden statue an Ifa oracle bowl, as these are used to the present day for divination among the Yoruba and some other peoples. In this context, it may be of some significance that the origin of Owo, in Owo oral tradition, is linked with the introduction of the sixteen sacred palm-kernel nuts kept in the Ifa oracle bowl, the Agere-Ifa (Abodiun 1989).\r\nAnyway, it may be inferred from the above that the Leiden statue has to be considered the only known and well-dated ivory statue, made for local use in the so-called Owo style.\r\nLITERATURE\r\nAbodiun R. 1989 The kingdom of Owo.
