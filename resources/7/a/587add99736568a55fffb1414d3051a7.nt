This cord was used to make dilly bags, also nets, 'not netted as an English net is done but of the same peculiar twisted stitch as the bag' (Bundock - Letter to the Secretary of the Amsterdam Exhibition, 1885). These nets were used in hunting kangaroos, and were sometimes as much as twenty yards long. Smaller nets were used for fishing." .
