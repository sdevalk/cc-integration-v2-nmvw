<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1485-292> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "It is not certain what exactly this object is. It was most likely worn as a charm or amulet around the neck on the chest or on the back. It could have been worn at war as a spiritual protection. \r\nVisible is a tube from woven beads with a fibre cord structure beneath it. A few strips of red cotton come out of it on one end. There are red, white and blue beads which make triangle patterns between red divisions. \r\nIt is possible that hair of someone's deceased relative, mostly parents, are wrapped in cotton and then put into the beaded tube. This would then be put on a string and worn around the neck. It was probably kept as a memory of the deceased and also had a protective function against ghosts, especially the deceased's ghost. How long it was worn and when it was worn is not clarified." .
