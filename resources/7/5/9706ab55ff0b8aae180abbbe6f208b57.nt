Cushing (cf. Stevenson 1883:371, fig. 491). War clubs were used in hand-to-hand combat, especially with Apaches and Navajos, the traditional enemies of the Zunis. Ten Kate recorded the names by which they referred to their enemies. The Tonto Apaches were called Tsji'shekwe (plundering people), the White Mountain Apaches Wilatsu'kwe (people with the lightning shell, meaning: sudden attackers).\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)" .
