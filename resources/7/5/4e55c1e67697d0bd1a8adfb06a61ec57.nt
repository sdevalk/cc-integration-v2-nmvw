A few of these boards were put on the wooden frame. The whole bed is part of the collection, it has been taken apart. A mattress from plaited palm leaves goes with it. \r\nThe beds were hardly long enough to hold the whole body, so people had to sleep with their knees up. \r\nThe beds were used as resting place, but also had a ceremonial function. It was used for weddings where the adorned bride was carried to her husband's house on such a bed. The bed was then part of the dowry. It is not sure whether sleeping beds and ceremonial beds had different designs or special motifs. \r\nDuring the day, beds would also serve as chairs and tables. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2802-95 1 t/m 11 op één kaart ; de maten van de slaapbank in z'n geheel L 187 cm, B 62, H 45 cm x?
