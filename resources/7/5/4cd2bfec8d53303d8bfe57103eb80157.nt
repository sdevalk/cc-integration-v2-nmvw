This bundle of dried grass has fine leaves about 90 cm. long. This grass was used to make the woven dilly bags, and presumably is the 'dilly bag grass' described by R.L. Dawson: Dilly bag grass grows in clumps, the stem is tall, flat and tough, and it is found usually in sandstone country. Years ago it was not plentiful but on the homestead ridge at Bentley between Casino and Lismore, I have seen black gins pounce eagerly upon it, gather it, and carefully stow it away for future use... The gins had some way of preparing the grass before weaving and the close woven finished work was extremely durable. (Dawson 1935:23).\r\n\r\n'Dulloom' genoemd en gebruikt als grondstof voor zakken en tassen. [Bron: beschrijvingskaart]" .
