De punt heeft een zuilvormig uit einde met twee flauwe ringvormige groevend, daaronder twee alternerende groepen, ieder van drie paar korte bilaterale weerhaken. Boven de punt een benen spits.\r\nOceanians  did not spend as much time trying to kill one another as they did in several other activities, but for many of them killing occupied a large amount of their thinking and influenced many of the other things they did. The most widely used active offensive weapons of Oceania were spears, axes, bows and arrows. New Guinea arrows have bamboo, wood or bone tips set in bamboo shafts. The shafts are approximately 5 feet long (150 cm) and the tips are secured with fine wrappings of bilum string or woven rattan. None of the arrows in New Guinea are feathered, and the end of the shaft is cut square, there being no nock. The arrows usually consist of a head composed of wood and a reed shaft. In one class of arrow there is added a bone point. Another class possesses a bamboo head which may be fastened directly into the shaft or into a piece of hard wood which in its turn is fastened into the shaft; this intermediate piece of wood is best termed an aftershaft. The shafts are sometimes decorated with painted or incised designs. Arrows account for the majority of battle wounds. But even at close range, where they are relatively accurate, they do not have the force to penetrate deeply. Unless they hit a particularly vulnerable spot, they are rarely fatal.  Arrows along with spears and bows were also used for hunting besides battles. Bamboo arrows, for instance, were widely used for bird- shooting." .
