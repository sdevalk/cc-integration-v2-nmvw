This specific set of sticks was used for the game referred to by the Spanish term of quince (fifteen; cf. Piman chapter, entry RMV 674-59). The gaming sticks Ten Kate collected are painted with four different designs on a white painted background, indicating part of the range of designs. The rounded backs of the sticks are stained red. The game was played by two men sitting opposite of one another, each casting the dice by hand or with a stone. Depending on the number of and what dice faced up, points were scored (Densmore 1932:195; Spier 1933:342-3, plate XIII; cf. Culin 1907:209-210).\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)" .
