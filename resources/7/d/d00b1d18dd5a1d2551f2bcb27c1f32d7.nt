The statue by the Scottish sculptor John Tweed was donated by Cecil John Rhodes and unveiled in 1899 at the location where Van Riebeeck was believed to have first set foot on the shore.\r\n\r\nIn 1969, the statue was moved to Adderley street where it was placed next to the statue of Van Riebeeck's wife Maria de la Queillerie which had been donated by the Dutch people to South Africa in 1954. \r\n\r\nAs a symbol of Dutch colonialism, Jan van Riebeeck was one of the most important Afrikaner nationalist symbols during the apartheid period. After the advent of democracy in South Africa, Van Riebeeck has become a controversial symbol of the colonial past and apartheid past." .
