<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-517-45> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This is some lime which was used for betel chewing. Normally, the lime would be transported in special gourds and taken out of there with a wooden spatula. \r\n\r\nThe betel chewing is an important, everyday activity. Women, men and even children do it while sitting together talking or on almost all other occasions. The consummation can be compared to the smoking of cigarettes in Western societies. It has been practised for a long time. An unripe areca or commonly known betel nut is chewed together with a leaf from the betel pepper. Then the lime, which is made by burning coral or shells, is added to the mixture in the mouth. The lime dissolves the alkaloids in the betel nut which have a stimulating effect, as much as they relieve fatigue and hunger. The mixture is not swallowed.\r\nThe betel colours the saliva and the teeth bright red. The betel is said to preserve the teeth from decay, but it also causes the gum to recede so that the teeth fall out. Old people which have no teeth have to grind the mixture in a mortar." .
