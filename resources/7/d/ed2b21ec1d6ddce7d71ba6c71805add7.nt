<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-2668-443> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Figure groups consist of two or more figures cast together on a flat base or plate. Although there are a range of different scenes captured in brass in these groups, there are some common motifs. One of the most common is that of the Ọba flanked on either side by the attendant chiefs Osa and Osuan, each supporting one of the Ọba’s arms. This pose is part of the annual Ague, or New Yam, festival and is depicted in and on many objects, from pendant plaques to relief plaques, highlighting the symbolic and ceremonial importance of this motif and pose. Unlike altar tableaux, the bases of these are flat (rather than raised platforms), and the figures are not in a square formation around the edge." .
