The Spanish word arpillera derives from an old Spanish word for burlap. They are sometimes called cuadros (squares). Most arpilleras are used as pictures and hung on walls. The most famous arpilleras and arpilleristas (the women who make them) are from Chile.\r\n\r\nArpilleristas make their arpilleras with scrap material, they embroider and sew it on burlap. They are cheap to make and do not require high technical skills, thus people from all social backgrounds can make arpilleras. The cloths are mostly embroidered in a communal setting, sharing one's story with the others not only through the cloth, but also verbally by narrating one's experience.\r\n\r\nThis arpillera focuses on the 1960 earthqaucke (and tsunami) originating from the southern cost of Chile. It is considered to be the largest earthquacke of the 20th century. its shock is generally agreed to have been of a magnitue between 9.4 and 9.6 and it was preceded by a series of foreshoks (also of high magnitude). This arpillerista is depicting the devastation that the earthquacke and tsunami did on the land. There are people laying on the ground, probably dead, some pieces (maybe houses as the Spanish embroidery read \"Casas destruida por el mar\") in the ocean and there is a helicopter in the sky towards which the standing figures are weaving their arms to get its attention. The sea is made with dark colour, maybe to represent the agitation of the water and the devastation it brought. The maker had, in all likelihood, written the name of the city/village/town with a red thread (teremoto y maremoto de 1959 en ...)." .
