For previous exhibitions, I have had De Verbeelding just outside of Amsterdam print it on 'Mirage Ilford Smooth Pearl' paper. For the framing, walnut/dark wood, skinny, like in the example that you've attached above. Good if there is a bit of space between the image and the frame like I've had previously, but not strictly necessary. Same with the glass." .
