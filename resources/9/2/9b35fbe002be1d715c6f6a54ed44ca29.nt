<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/14b7f53fedcf36d91ee311ff35909caf> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The calung is a xylophone with a light construction of bamboo for a frame and 16 bamboo keys that are fixed with strings to this frame. Made by Sanusi from Kaduketug who was recorded playing this instrument on September 9th 1976 in Jakarta (Indonesia).\r\nThe Baduy are a group of approximately 12.000 people, who live in west Java (Kanékés village, Kabupaten Lebak, Province of Banten, Indonesia). Their community is divided in the Outer- and the Inner-Baduy. The Inner-Baduy live very isolated, following strict rules.\r\nDuring several periods of fieldwork between 1976 to 2016, Wim van Zanten collected these instruments of the music he was studying, and brought them back home to use as study-material. Especially the flutes he played often, because they offered him musical information. After finishing his research and publication he donated these to the National Museum of World Cultures.\r\nThis xylophone is no longer complete. Part of the frame is lacking." .
