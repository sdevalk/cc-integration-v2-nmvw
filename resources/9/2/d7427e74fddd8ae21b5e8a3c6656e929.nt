The fibre strings are tied to the body all along its length. Several places are covered with bunches of white feathers.\r\n\r\nThe object was collected by Father J. Verschueren during a ritual celebration in Wajaw (Kumbe-river) in November 1957. It is an emblem of the Kai-ze and Ndik-end clan, both of Aramemb phratry, emblem used in a performance, sapra, on the occasion of the cult celebration. This snake ornament was carried during the ritual re-enactment of the myth about the thirsty dema, who was bitten by the snake, zanid, in the ear (lobe?), while he was drinking from the well.\r\n\r\nAccording to a myth zanid was born to a girl who was raped by Yawima, a thunder-maker. Zanid in turn bit him in his ear and Yawima, because of a big pain, run away and nobody could find him (Van Baal, 1966: 289).\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 28.11. 2006" .
