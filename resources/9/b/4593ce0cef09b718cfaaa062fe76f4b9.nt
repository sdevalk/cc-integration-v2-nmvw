It depicts the mosque in Mecca, with in the center the Ka’ba, surrounded by minarets, the mosque’s walls, and various smaller religious buildings. Pilgrims would take souvenirs to mark the end of the hajj, and to display their new status as hajji to the people at home. With this object, we would like to show how the Ka’ba and its mosque are depicted in various artistic forms and time periods." .
