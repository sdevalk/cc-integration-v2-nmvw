Men paint the \" Songlines\":  the roads that the mythological ancestors travelled when they gave the world her shape. Traditionally you will find in these paintings concentric circles and connecting lines so that the artworks look like topographical maps. Subjects of the paintings of the female artists are the land, personal Dreamings and the the gathering and preparing of food.Many female artists are becoming well-known as contemporary artists with an innovative way of painting. They experiment with colours, shapes and techniques.\r\n\r\nCentral to the women's role in caring for the land are their dancing ceremonies, and this practice is at the core of the development of their art. A group of women who painted each other's bodies in preparation for the ceremonies. For most of these women, the time spent decorating and singing and getting ready for the ceremony is far more important than the actual ceremony itself. they used symbols for body painting and for seeds and grasses. From early on, Gloria Ptyarre made swirling patterns of these ceremonial symbols. As she began to work in acrylic paint on canvas, these patterns soon came to fill the whole of her pictures." .
