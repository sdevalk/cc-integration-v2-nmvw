<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-3532-8> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This dance ornament representing a snake (zanid or azanid) is carved from a single piece of a long wooden stick. The fibre strings are tied to the body all along its length. Several places are covered with bunches of white feathers.\r\n\r\nThe object was collected by Father J. Verschueren during a ritual celebration in Wajaw (Kumbe-river) in November 1957. It is an emblem of the Kai-ze and Ndik-end clan, both of Aramemb phratry, emblem used in a performance, sapra, on the occasion of the cult celebration. This snake ornament was carried during the ritual re-enactment of the myth about the thirsty dema, who was bitten by the snake, zanid, in the ear (lobe?), while he was drinking from the well.\r\n\r\nAccording to a myth zanid was born to a girl who was raped by Yawima, a thunder-maker. Zanid in turn bit him in his ear and Yawima, because of a big pain, run away and nobody could find him (Van Baal, 1966: 289).\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 28.11. 2006" .
