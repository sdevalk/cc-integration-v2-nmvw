<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/3a128ca84aa282d5070f346d6488a2df> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Aboriginal man met witte baard en scarificaties op borst. De man werd zittend gefotografeerd naast een meetlat. Hij draagt ook armbanden aan zijn bovenarmen (Wonu Veys, juni 2011). \r\n\r\nAboriginal man with white beard and scarifications on chest. The man was photographed seated with a measuring tape next to him. He is wearing armbands (Wonu Veys, juni 2011).\r\n\r\nPaul Foelsche arrived in Port Darwin just as the study of other peoples and cultures was being recognised as a new field of Western science, 'Anthropology'. Foelsche contributed to this study, by recording vocabularies and making observations on the culture of the Larrakia, Woolna and Iwaidja peoples. His portrait photographs became a crucial element in this anthropological record.\r\n\r\nFoelsche's first anthropological records were his 1874 photographs of Larrakia camps. His portrait photography was initially made with a measuring scale, but his participation in the photography sections of International Exhibitions gave his photographs a broader appeal. He began carefully recording the names of his sitters, and their personal details. This was quite unusual for nineteenth-century anthropology.\r\n\r\nDuring 1880 Foelsche responded to E.M. Curr's Australia-wide survey, supplying descriptions of the Larrakia and the Unalla (Iwaidja) peoples, together with samples of their vocabularies.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the South Australian Museum, Foelsche prepared a fuller account of the Larrakia, submitting this to the Adelaide branch of the Royal Society in 1881, together with a set of anthropometric photographs.\r\n\r\nDuring 1889 Foelsche responded to a call from the South Australian Museum and made a carefully documented collection of artefacts, listing their Aboriginal names and uses. During this period Foelsche prepared several collections for other museums and collectors.\r\n\r\nIn his time, Foelsche was an acknowledged authority on anthropology. By today's standards, this reputation does not bear close examination. Although he was careful to record Aboriginal names correctly, he spoke only a form of Aboriginal pidgin English. He made one attempt to document Larrakia and Iwaidja origin myths, but he had little understanding of Aboriginal religion or social structure. Indeed, few Europeans did.\r\n\r\nBut Foelsche clearly appreciated that Aboriginal society had its own valid laws, and that European law was an alien imposition. He understood his own role in altering that balance. Writing to a friend in Germany after his retirement, Foelsche put it in these terms:\r\n\r\n    This is an Old Country with an Old People. The New People must remember the claims of the Old People. They were here first, and they have their established customs and institutions. So far as those customs and institutions can be related to our standards, they must be respected. For illegalities, there must be understanding.\r\n    â€” S. Downer, Patrol Indefinite, 1963\r\n\r\nPhotographs\r\n\r\nPaul Foelsche's photography of Aboriginal people began as a response to the late 19th century interest in 'racial types', as a branch of the new 'science' of Anthropology. These first images often incorporated a measurement scale. But Foelsche saw these people as individuals, rather than as scientific specimens. He began recording the names of his subjects, their ages and language groups.\r\n\r\nThe Aboriginal people in Foelsche's portraits had to keep still for two or three seconds, in order to produce a clear, unblurred image. This fixed pose tended to make them appear serious, even concerned, but the same may be said of European portraits of the late 19th century. Despite Foelsche's role as a law-enforcer, the evidence suggests that Aboriginal people were willing participants in his photographic project. (gekopieerd door W.Veys, juni 2011)" .
