<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1485-822> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This wooden board is probably the handle of a coconut ladle. \r\nIt is a longish rectangular which has a little knob on one end. This was stuck into half a coconut and glued to it with Parinarium putty being parallel to the rim of the coconut.\r\nThe side facing away from the coconut is coloured only in red while the front has carved patterns which are coloured red, black and white. It shows very symmetrical triangle patterns. \r\n\r\nThe ladle was used to scoop liquids and solid food from pots and kettles, often from a big wooden bowl. This was often done on feasts, to give out soup to guests. The ladles were kept in the house of the men and were sometimes a present to guests." .
