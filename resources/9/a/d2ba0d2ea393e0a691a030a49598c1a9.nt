It has a cylindrical upper part and opens up into a bell-shaped body which is hollowed out. There are little holes all round the rim of the opening and fibre cords are tied to them. They have shell discs, red dried seeds and Job's tears woven into them. When these strings are moved and they bang against the wood or against each other, it causes the rattling noise. \r\nMost of the time, several rattles are attached to the apron worn by men during dance ceremonies." .
