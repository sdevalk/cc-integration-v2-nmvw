Following a fire in 1896, the residence was reconstructed in the Cape Dutch style by the architect sir Herbert Baker. \r\n\r\nThe estate is located in Rondebosch on the slopes of Table Mountain. In the 20th century it became the official residence of the prime ministers and later presidents of South Africa. Since 1994 the building is no longer used as an official residence and operates as a museum." .
