<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7106-684> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "A pivotal factor in the Islanders subsistence lifestyle was mastery at fishing using the various implements and tools on-hand. Hand-line, Ngurupai wharf depicts one such method - the hand-line.\r\nTraditionally fishing was done from the shores around the reefs either by use of fishing lines made from vine or vegetable fibre, with hooks fashioned from turtle shell, or with spears. In the Eastern Islands, where large schools of sardines are found along the shoreline, a bamboo scoop (weres) was used.\r\n\r\nThis print is one in a series of works that looks at the juxtaposition of Torres Strait lifestyle with motifs and mythology from classical Renaissance art." .
