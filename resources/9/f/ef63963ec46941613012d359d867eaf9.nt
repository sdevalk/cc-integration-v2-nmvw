He was born in Sichuan province and considered as one of the most important poets in Song Dynasty. His father Su Xun(??) and younger brother Su Zhe (??)were also famous poets in that time, so people called them \"Three Su\"to show respect to their Su family. Su shi left behind 2.700 poems, 300 statement poems and many essays,  many of which are masterpieces learnt and repeated  from generation to generation. Su shi also can be counted in those  writers who had written works of the largest quantity and the best quality in the Chinese literature history. Besides his great merits in literature, Su Shi also made outstanding accomplishments in calligraphy, painting, medicine, etc.\r\n\r\nhttp://lib.hzu.edu.cn/link/dp/\r\n\r\nJing Tan, 2008." .
