Dit type waterdruppelaar was zeer populair aan het eind van de negentiende eeuw.\r\n\r\nWater droppers provided water to mix with ground ink. Most of water droppers were made of porcelain with various colours and shapes. This carp-shaped water dropper was probably used by a scholar to add water to his ink stone when doing calligraphy. This fish motif was symbolic of success in the state examinations and therefore was popularly used in folk paintings and crafts of the Choson period. \r\nMoreover, it symbolized courage, perseverance, and success. Carp legends came from China, but as an art and design motif the Carp was much more popular in Korea than in China, probably because of the deep-seated Korean belief in Taoist-inspired Shaminist magic. Real carp are popular pets in the Far East. They grow quite large and become tame enough to eat out of one hand. Brightly coloured ones are especially prized. Since they are considered auspicious, a fisherman who catches one is supposed to throw it back. However, with the usual Far Eastern contradictoriness, carp is a popular culinary delicacy and carp soup is a traditional tonic said to restore vigour. \r\nCarp symbolism was based on observed reality. Like salmon, they swim upstream to spawn, struggling against the current, negotiating rapids, and leaping over waterfalls along the way. In their heroic efforts to ascend the falls, they jump again and again until they either make it or die. Thus the Carp came to signify courage, perseverance, endurance, vigor, and success. The painting of a Carp hung on the wall in a boy? room was meant to inspire these qualities. \r\nThe carp as a success symbol derives from an old Chinese legend about the carp of the yellow river. The ones that managed to swim all the way upstream past the rapids at Lung Men (Dragon Gate) turned into Dragons and ascended to the sky. Korean folk paintings of Carp nearly always depict them leaping out of the water. Sometimes they are shown turning into Dragons in the process. Occasionally they are represented as composite Carp-Dragons. \r\nJumping Carp paintings were very prevalent in Choson Dynasty Korea. Beyond their auspicious symbolism of courage and success, they performed an important Shamanist magic function at home. Such a painting hung on the wall above the bed of a newly married woman was supposed to inspire her to dream of a Jumping Carp (or of a Dragon) Such a dream meant she would give birth to a son, and that he would be successful in life. The significance of Jumping Carp paintings can scarcely be overestimated, since bearing sons was a Choson Dynasty wife's first duty." .
