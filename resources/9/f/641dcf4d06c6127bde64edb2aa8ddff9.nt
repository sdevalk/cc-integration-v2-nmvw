<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7260-32> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Angklung, part of an angklung ensemble of 9 bamboo idiophones and two drums. This angklung set was recorded in Jakarta, 8-9 September 1976.\r\nThe Baduy are a group of approximately 12.000 people, who live in west Java (Kanékés village, Kabupaten Lebak, Province of Banten, Indonesia). Their community is divided in the Outer- and the Inner-Baduy. The Inner-Baduy live very isolated, following strict rules.\r\nWim van Zanten bought these instruments in september 1976 from Badui in Kanékés village (Lebak, Indonesia) and brought them back home to use as study-material.After finishing his research and publication he donated these to the National Museum of World Cultures.\r\nMost angklung instruments are now damaged and no longer produce a proper sound." .
