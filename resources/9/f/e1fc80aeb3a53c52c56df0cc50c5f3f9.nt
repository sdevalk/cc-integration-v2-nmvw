Als 666-91, maar dan zonder de de ringen aan de bladrand en het handvat.\r\n\r\nBrass keyring with a handle and round body. Around the edge of the round part, small rings have been attached. These rings are used to tie various small accessories to the keyring. Keyrings like this come in a variety of forms, including square, rounded, bag, dragon, or bat shapes.\r\n\r\nAround the end of the Choseon period, the keyring was a popular item to include in the dowry a noble woman brought into her husband’s family and was given by the mother to her daughter. \r\nThe overall design is a maze of round and flower shapes that are connected inside the ring. Human figures as well as animals such as fish and butterflies can be found. On this keyring, many auspicious Chinese characters and expressions decorate the circular shapes, such as “seven treasures / ch’ilpo“ and characters for well-being, health, and good fortune. It is therefore decorative, but has a strong meaning as a talisman as well, warding off unfortunate and evil powers.\r\nAlthough this example does not show it very clearly, these keyrings often refer to symbolic currency and are seen as items to remember an auspicious occasion such as marriage or anniversaries. Some resemble a collection of coins soldered together.\r\n\r\nThe key ring in the Onyang folk museum collection is rather small (L 11.2 cm ; W 9.8 cm) and shaped differently, but holes and rings around the shape look similar to 666-90, 666-91.  Since the key rings like this is shown together with one, identical to 666-90, 666-91 in the collection of Mr. Robert Moore, we can assume that items are used for keeping keys.  According to the Onyang folk museum, the daughter of a noble family would received the key ring as a wedding gift from her mother, and apart from the item, more than 50 different key rings of this type have been found.  It is said that later the key rings were used to decorate women's rooms with gaudy accessories attached to it." .
