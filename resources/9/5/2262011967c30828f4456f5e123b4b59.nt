<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/c31d5d8bfab7cc32227c0fd1a56a7194> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Een op een hoge voet staande van dunne strips bamboe gevlochten koekschaal met deksel. Van binnen zijn schaal en deksel rood verlakt. Zowel op de breed uitlopende voet als op de buitenrand van het deksel zijn uit heel fijne strips bamboe  decoratieve lussen gemaakt. De staande voet heeft ter hoogte van het midden een kleine uitstulping.\r\n\r\nAnonymous: Presentation Box for Sweets\r\nOnce every four years, that is from 1790, the Dutch Captain of Deshima and two others, made the journey to Edo for the exchange of gifts, providing an update on the situation in the rest of the world, sharing information with various parties subsidiary to the ruler of Japan, the Shogun. This 'court journey', the Edo sanpu, also provided an occasion to buy objects for their collections for people such as Blomhoff, Fisscher and Siebold. In his account of the court journey in which he took part, in 1822, Fisscher remarks that the best basketry work was to be found at Fuchu, near the Hakone mountain district. It seems most likely that this box for sweets, okashibako, was bought in one of the shops in that town. \r\nIt, indeed, qualifies as the best in basketry work, made of very thin strips of bamboo plaited around a wooden bowl and provided with a plaited stand, the lid also made of wood and again provided with a plaited fitting and finial. What makes it really special, in addition to its most unusual shape, is the refinement in the alternating patterns, from a simple straight and rather tight plaiting at the bottom of the bowl, developing into a zigzag pattern curving around the major part of the bowl, intersected at various places with most exquisite adornments of various kinds. One surprise must have been when such a bowl on a high stand, in shape almost reminiscent of a chalice, would be brought to a party gathered in a dinner party. A second surprise would have been that it would contain sweets, while a third surprise would have been that the inside of the presentation box of such a highly unusual shape would be a shiny red lacquer. \r\nIt would seem that there is only one other of the kind known to exist, also in the Leiden Museum, and only since Fisscher could not refrain himself from buying two at the time. In the absence of any possibility for comparison with other similar objects, the combination of the pedigree of the pair of presentation boxes for sweets and the circumstance that they seem to have been bought as new items in a shop at Fuchu on the occasion of the 1822 court journey, allows us to date them as manufactured in 1821 - by a highly skilled artisan.\r\n\r\nThis object probably acquired by Johan van Overmeer Fisscher at Fuchu, during the 1822 court journey to that city in which Fisscher partook.\r\n\r\nThis description was written for the ASEMUS virtual master pieces project." .
