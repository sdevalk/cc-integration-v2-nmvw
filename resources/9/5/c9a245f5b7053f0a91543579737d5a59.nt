This is a full grooved type.\r\n(Wilcox 2008-09)\r\n\r\nHalonawan material culture\r\nIn the decades preceding A.D. 1300 many small settlements in the wider Zuni area were abandoned, and large pueblos emerged in the Ramah-El Morro region, east of present-day Zuni Pueblo. In the 14th century a shift in location took place and new towns emerged on a short stretch on the Zuni River and Ojo Caliente Wash, most of these still occupied in historic times. These included Halonawan North, on the present site of Zuni Pueblo and now virtually completely covered by the modern village, and Halonawan South, just south of the pueblo, across the Zuni River. Cushing' s house at Zuni was built directly on top of the site. Grayware was the most prevalent pottery type excavated at Halonawan South, accounting for almost 50%, followed by St. Johns redwares (17%) and Tularosa black-on-white (8%). The main occupation of this site is dated as from 1275 to 1325 A.D. (Kintigh 1985; Anyon 1992; Huntley and Kintigh 2004; Kintigh et.al. 2004).\r\n(Wilcox and Hovens 2008-09)" .
