Hood only; object lacks long soft cover which would have wrapped around infant’s body (see 710-14 Yanktonai soft cradle).\r\n\r\nThe stripe style was an early preferred design among the Cheyenne. The beaded disc with a four point motif is protective; the number four held sacred significance among Central Plains tribes. To the Cheyenne it might represent their culture hero, “morning star.” Or it might represent the four directions, the home of the winds and the thunders (Wissler 1907:48-52).\r\n\r\nThe simple, bold composition of these stripes in seed beads reflects a style popular in the Central and Northern Plains in an earlier period, worked in larger pony beads, and also in porcupine quills and in paint. On a man’s shirt, lines may have represented coups counted in war. On a woman’s hide storage bag red lines may have represented the female reproductive cycle and female path of life. Without specific collection information it is impossible to know what the maker intended by beading these green lines on this cradle hood, but the designs as a whole were surely meant as protection and good wishes for the infant within.\r\n\r\nAt birth the Cheyenne infant’s umbilical cord was cut with a knife; the navel area was dusted with powder from the prairie puffball, as were the inside of his legs, to keep them from chafing. He was wrapped securely in a piece of hide or cloth. The umbilical cord was dried and saved in a decorated hide container, sometimes in the shape of a turtle or a lizard. These creatures were difficult to kill, and therefore considered a powerful protection. This amulet was often hung on the cradle and served as the child’s first toy. Sometimes these soft cradles were attached to lattice wood frameworks for greater portability. When the infant was strong enough to be put in such a cradleboard, he might be easily carried on his mother’s back, or hung on a lodge pole, or leaned against the side of the lodge, or suspended from a horse’s saddle pommel or a travois pole. Even dogs carried travois with baby cradles on them, with the mother holding firmly to their line (Grinnell 1923:104-7). The portability of the cradle board made it ideal for traveling in the earlier nomadic days.\r\n\r\nA decorated cradle was a prestige item giving honor to the child and to the family. Some children received many cradles at their birth. These gifts were reciprocated by the family; sometimes a horse was given to the donor. Many infants had no fancy cradles. They were simply wrapped (or swaddled) in tight little bundles, and held in their mother’s laps. As they got older, they would ride on their mothers’ backs, naked, facing forward, held in place by a blanket wrapped around them and tucked under their buttocks, the blanket held closed in front by the mother.  Whether in a cradle or not, the Plains infant was always near his or her mother or other family members. Older sisters carried younger ones around on their backs, and took them to their play villages, where they tended to them and pretended to be their real mothers. The Plains infant was never alone.\r\n\r\nBarbara Hail\r\nHaffenreffer Museum of Anthropology, Bristol, RI; 2015\r\n\r\nGeorge Bird Grinnell, The Cheyenne Indians: Their History and Ways of Life, vol. 1; Yale University Press; New Haven, 1923.
