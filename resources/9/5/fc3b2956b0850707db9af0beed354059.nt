<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-253-111> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Fine example of a 'wunda' shield, of light wood, decorated with geometric design comprising curving parallel incisions painted alternately in red ochre and white pipeclay. Used for protection against spears. \r\nReverse of shield is also engraved with parallel carving, divided into three panels by two transverse lines at each end of handle. There are diagonal abrasions or scratches across the upper and lower panels. Similar abrasions have been noted on the reverse of shields in the Broome area of W.A., further to the north of this example,  evidence of the shield's use as a 'cutting board'. The shield's general shape, together with this characteristic and the closely arranged decorative incisions on the face, all suggest that this shield is from the northernmost extent of the usual range of these shields, as documented by Davidson.\r\nPareerschild van hout, ovaal van vorm, aan de achterzijde met uitgesneden handgreep. De voorkant is versierd met parallelsgewijs ingesneden verticale lijnen, waarin op één plaats een curve is opgenomen. De groeven zijn gekleurd met witte en donkerbruine verf, om en om.\r\n\r\nThis light, softwood spear-shield was collected from the Kimberley ranges of north Western Australia during the late 19th century. The incised grooves are alternately highlighted with ochre, accentuating the undulating effect." .
