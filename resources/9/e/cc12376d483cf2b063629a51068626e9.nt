Although the creation of pottery figures of people and animals had a long tradition in the Southwest and even reached into prehistoric times, the storyteller figure was an innovation in Cochiti in the 1960s. Helen Cordero (1915-1994) is credited with its invention in 1964: a male figure of an adult telling stories to a host of little children sitting on top and around him, appealing to Pueblo traditions of storytelling and passing oral traditions on to new generations. Helen Cordero’s original storyteller, and all others she made after that, was that of a grandfather and his grandchildren, and was inspired by her own grandfather Santiago Quintana. When she made female figures with children she did not call these storytellers, but Singing Mothers. In 1979 the Adobe Gallery in Albuquerque organized the first show of storytellers with work by Helen Cordero, Seferina Ortiz, Dorothy Trujillo, Mary Frances Herrera and Rita Lewis. The storyteller theme galvanized other potters to produce similar figures, and almost immediately caught the attention of visitors and tourists. Production mushroomed, at first hardly able to keep up with popular demand. And soon, varieties on the storyteller theme appeared, with bears becoming the most popular.\r\n\t\r\n\tSeferina Ortiz (1931-2007) came from a family engaged in the making of pottery figures for several generations. Her most prominent predecessor was her great aunt Estephanita Herrera, also known as Grandma Honey, who made large size animal figurines, including pitchers in bird shapes. Seferina Ortiz learned pottery making from her mother Laurencita Herrera. In addition to human storytellers, she produced the same subject with lizards, turtles, frogs and owls. She also developed new figures, such as “bathing beauties” and mermaids, inspired by scenes at Cochiti Lake when construction of the dam created this body of water in the desert and became a favorite spot for swimming. In turn, Seferina passed her knowledge and skills on to her daughters Inez, Janice and Joyce, and son Virgil Ortiz, whose innovative figurative work catches anyone’s attention (Babcock et.al. 1986:34,39-41; Dillingham 1994:120-127; Batkin 1999:32-40; Clark 2006:80-101). When he visited The Netherlands in 2006 Virgil was very proud when Pieter Hovens showed him his mother’s storyteller figure and an earlier small canteen with animal figures (RMV 5715-2450) in the museum collection at Leiden.\r\n\r\n\tWork by Seferina Ortiz is represented in major museums, including the Peabody Museum of Harvard University in Boston (Drooker and Capone 1998:24,27,72-75) and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. In addition to Seferina Ortiz’ storyteller, the Leiden museum curates several other storytellers from Cochiti by Dorothy Trujillo (RMV 6134-31, 6190-1 and 7), recently donated by her Dutch potterymaking friend Margot Spiegel-Kramer.\r\n\r\nPieter Hovens\r\nRijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde, Leiden, NL; 2015\r\n\r\nBarbara Babcock, Guy and Doris Monthan, The Pueblo Storyteller: Development of a Figurative Ceramic Tradition; University of Arizona Press; Tucson, 1986.

Deze \"verhalenvertellers\" (storytellers) zijn voor het eerst gemaakt door Helen Cordero van Cochiti Pueblo en worden nu door veel pottenbakkers, met eigen variaties, gemaakt. Aanvankelijk waren het alleen vrouwenfiguurtjes, later ook mannen. Er zijn ook vertellerfiguurtjes van een beer met kleine beren." .
