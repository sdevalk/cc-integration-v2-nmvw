This is not to offend the artist, he himself would readily agree - and that is, probably the reason he signed much of his work, including this painting, as Shôjô Kyôsai, or 'the Drunkard Kyôsai'. The signs of how and when he made this painting can easily been seen in its brushwork. It must, indeed, have been one of these evenings, gathering with friends and sharing the booze. The party then probably landed on the subject of the foreigners coming to Japan in ever larger numbers, whereupon Kyôsai pulled a piece of paper, his brush and started making ink, simply to illustrate what his tongue could no longer express: 'foreigner, gaijin, you know, wearing pot hats and riding horses, red-haired, at least red-bearded, like this'. And so he started painting, what he could best, not bothering to make all necessary preparations, laying the paper directly on the tatami matting - and we still see the traces of that in the brush strokes. The pattern of the tatamis is still to be seen - and appreciated - in the brush-strokes, witnessing the exact circumstances when Kyôsai made the painting.\r\nCapable of painting a horse in a most realistic way - Kyôsai must have had an absolute sight in much the same way that others have an absolute pitch - he here restricted himself to simply paint what immediately strikes us as a horse with rider. Moreover, with the horse riding straight towards us, but probably passing, he has even in these circumstances, chosen a more difficult viewpoint than just simply painting the horse sideways. And whatever the discussion about the foreigner, we cannot really make a judgment whether he considered their presence as good or bad, or simply funny. Basically this is a foreigner on horseback, essentially it is a great painting.\r\n\r\nThis description was written for the ASEMUS virtual master pieces project." .
