Hiervan hangen 6 kleinere ringenaf. 4 hiervan hebben nog - afhangend - kleinere ringetjes van schildpad en schelp. Aan een hiervan hangt, aan een reepje katoen, een blauw-glazen kraal.\r\n\r\nThe use of tortoise shell was very abundant in the whole of Papua when Sande visited it. Yet one never finds here the ring obtained by boring, known in the north half of Papua New Guinea but always the kind which consist of a small, narrow strip bent round and which is even traded away to the interior also to Lake Sentani. \r\nAll sorts of ear ornaments are suspended by these tortoise shell rings like ornamental pieces made from sea shell. They are sometimes traded away in a finished state but rough sea shell are also exchanged. People of the interior made their ornaments from them. \r\nOther rings could be suspended from the earrings. In Seka, Sande saw small hollow of bone rings. In Nacheibe mother of pearl was in use whereas in Sageisara many women had large chains of tortoise shell rings from ear to ear with the bight reaching halfway down the chest.  Sande noticed that according to Parkinson (1900) this ornament was characteristic of Aitape and surroundings. Yet in 1903, it saw it in Sageisara. \r\nAccording to Sande, who quoted De Clercq and Schmeltz, piercing takes place at the age of 3 to 5. He noticed that in contrast with other places, in Humboldt Bay, women wear more ornaments than men.  \r\nMen also wear earrings made with hornbill mandible and phalanges of Pteroptus, at Jachonto and at Ifar for example (See 1528-218). \r\nSee Kaufmann, 1992, p. 146, fig. 6, Photograph by Paul Wirz shoing two women with this ears ornaments." .
