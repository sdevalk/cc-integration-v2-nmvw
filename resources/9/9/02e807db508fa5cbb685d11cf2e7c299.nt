The coconut is freed from all outer hair and then smoothed. A bamboo cane is glued to the small opening on the top  and serves as a bottleneck. The whole coconut with the neck is coated in Parinarium putty. This coat has incisions, which are painted white and red. There is an elevated Parinarium ring around the centre of the nut. The manufacture was the work of men. \r\nThe vessel serves as water container and as a bottle to pour water." .
