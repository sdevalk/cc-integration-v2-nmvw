It was engraved into a stele in the 19th year of the Emperor Kangxi (1680 A.D.) and the stele is now kept in the Xian Beilin.\r\n\r\nThe pine and crane have been a popular theme in Chinese painting, as they symbolize longevity. The pine is a perennial evergreen tree which is able to survive in very cold weather. And the crane's lifespan can reach up to fifty or sixty years.\r\n\r\nThis painting of pine and crane is drawn with much refinement and has been delicately carved onto the stele. It can be regarded as one of the most important art pieces on this theme. \r\n\r\nJing Tan, 2008." .
