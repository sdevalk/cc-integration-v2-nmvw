<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/d552291bbd755fb30ac97fa7a61c7203> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "In 1999, Moniek Toebosch was commission by the Volkenkunde Museum to create a public work which would be part of the Beelden rondom Volkenkunde public work series. For this piece Moniek sought to create what she called: public sounds for private spaces. The work is entitled Les doleurs contemporaines V. She was at first hesitant of the commission, questioning the role of artists in the museum and the authoritative aspect the commission took on, but finally agreed saying: “I accepted the National Museum of Ethnology invitation to produce work for them due to my interest in the different ways people come to terms with grief, or rather the way in which different cultures go through the process of disengagement.”\r\n\r\n    Her experimental sound piece consisted of music made from various instruments within the collection as well as distorted noises of grief and cries. This acted as a sonic reminder of the grief, loss and burden associated with the items within the museum. The sounds fill in the gap between origin and displacement. Her work was also made to be in more private, functional but forgotten spaces, the coat and locker room. This placement took the focal point away from the object, not to use the sound as a score or an informant, but instead to captivate a sense of general feeling and atmosphere when it is least expected." .
