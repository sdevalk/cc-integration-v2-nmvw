Regarding the pillars, Fergusson says - \"The proportion of diameter to height; the entasis; the proportion between the upper and lower diameter; the capital and its abacas; the base with its plinth; the architrave, &c., are so like the Roman order, that it is difficult to conceive of the likeness being accidental. How the pillars came there we do not know; but we must not overlook the fact, that in the traditions collected by Dr. Bastian, and more especially in those extracted from Siamese books by Col. Low, nothing is so commonly asserted and insisted upon as the presence of a prince of Rome, of Romans, and of white men.\"*\r\n\r\n*Fergusson's Architecture.
