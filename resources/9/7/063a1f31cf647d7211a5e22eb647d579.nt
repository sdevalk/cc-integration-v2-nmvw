Boven aan het doek zijn vissen, hagedissen en bush bloemen afgebeeld. \r\n\r\nGURUWANA STORY  (the fishtrap)\r\nA long time ago way back in the dreamtime a man named Marrngu, the Possum man, and his two wives, Barkuma (native cats: dhuwa) lived at a place called Guruwana. One day the Barkuma sisters went out to collect shells from the mangroves. Marrngu, who was going to marry them stayed at the camp. They went into into the mangroves and collected dhongu'(lined nerite), nanda (telscope mud creeper) and then came back to their camp to cook. Butbecause the sisters despised Marrngu the Possum-man to be theirhusband, they made the fire extra large to cook the shells in. As they went about cooking the shells, theyplotted what they were going to do to Marrngu, the Possum man.\r\nThat night their husband came and sat near the fire to warm himself and to reconcile with the sisters as they refused to sleep with him.\r\nThen as Marrngu was warming himself near the fire, the sisters threw the hot coals and ashes all over him, shrivelling his arms and legs.\r\nMarrngu then got up turned into a possum and ran away screaming from pain; wot, wot, wot, wot. That is why nowadays marrngu,the ringtail possum, have pink skin on i's body as a results from hot coals and ashes.\r\nThe crowman, Wak, had made a fishtrap-Gorl so they can have fish. Here the fish are caught, eaten and the fishbones are put aside so that they can put the fishbones into a 'Hollow Log' coffin later. When Marrngu ran away from the Barkuma sisters he came up to the Crowman and told him what had happened, how the sisters had humilated him and then they tried to kill him. He also warned the Crowman what he is going to do to the sisters. Then Marrnguwent away, gathered his clansmen and returned to kill the women. The miringu (army) gathered in groups at the edge of the plain, then they went in and speared the sisters to death.\r\nThe plce where they killed the sisters is now call Molumirr to this day. It means that, this was the place where the Barkuma sisters had been killed. Where the armies gathered in groups on the plain, now stands small groups of bushes, gulun'gulun to signify where the miringu once stood). Their spirit entered the body of the catfish, wedu, in the nearby river. When the Wak heard about the women's death, he got upset he went to Warang the Glider Possum man, the 'boss' of the Hollow Log. The Wak wanted to arrange a 'Hollow Log'  ceremony for the dead women. After preparing the Hollow Log Coffin they collected all the catfish bones and placed them into a Dindin (paperbark basket), they would later put the catfish bones into the Hollow Log. To do this, they painted the Hollow Log and had a big Bunggul ( mortuary rite). They dance and all night until late in the night. They ceremononially placed the catfish bones ( 2 sisters' bones) into the Hollow Log Coffin, then the Wak came and took the hollow log coffin away and flew into the heavens. That hollow log coffin can now be seen as the Mi9lky Way. And that is how the Milky Way was formed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAMINGINING\r\nRamingining is a small community of around 590 people, of whom about 30 are non-Aboriginal people, mostly advisors or teacherrs of some sort or another. The village itself is located some 400 kms to the east of Darwin, and nearly 30 kms from the Arafura Sea. It is a relatively new settlement, having only been established in the early 1970's. \r\n\r\nEarlier, in the 1960's an outstation of Milingimbi was set up at Nangalalala [ 8 kms N/E of Ramingining], a kilometre or so from the Glyde River. Ther older settlement Milingimbi Mission, was established in 1926 and is in fact situated on an island a few kilometres off the north Australia coastline. Nangala is still in existence, and is now considered an outstation of Ramingining.\r\nThe area around Ramingining on the mainland is home for the Djinang speaking Wurrkigenydjarr/Marrangu, Wulaki, Mildjingi, Balmbi and Murrungun clans.  In a wider circle are the Burarra, Rembarrnga, Wudamin, Ganalbingu and Manharrngu peoples. To the north are the Gorryindi, Gamalangga, Malarra and Walamangu peoples who look after the Crocodile Islands. Other people who live there and have ceremonial connections are members of the Gupapuyngu, Djambarrpuyngu, Wagilag, Liyagalawumir and Liya-gawumirr groups.  \r\nThe particular tract of land upon which Ramingining township is built is owned by the Djadawitjibi people, of the Djiang group. Their principal creative being is Garrtjambal, the kangaroo.\r\nSome 10-20 kms to the south of the village of Ramingining, where the looping Glyde River becomes the Goyder, is the large Arafura Swamp. Some 250 sq kms in area, this unique fresh water environment is home for an innumerable variety of water birds (including gurramatji, the magpie goose), fresh water plants, fields of water lilies, crocodiles, water snakes, insect life, and the magnificent and rare Corypha elata palm. (hundred year palm?).\r\nRamingining is situated upon the richest bauxite deposit (outside Nhuunboy) in Australia, possibly the world. The missionaries realised this and deliberately established the community at the present site to thwart mining company development and associated problems as present in Nhulunboy.\r\n\r\nThe Art\r\nThe art of Ramingining has always been highly prized and is still today pursued by some of the best known living artists in Arnhemland Land. However until the 70's, when the settlement of Ramingining was established, most of the art work of this area was circulated to the outside world either through the Art Centre at Milingimbi, or the Government settlement of Maningrida, some 80 kms to the west towards Darwin.\r\nNow the Art Centre at Ramingining has come into its own; somewhat ironically, it now services the older settlement at Milingimbi. The result of this change in the last decade is that now all art is chanelled beyond the region of its production through the Ramingining community's own Art Co-operative, Bulabula Arts.\r\nThis is a locally owned and controlled artists co-operative whose role is to 'market' the work of local painters, weavers, and sculptors to the outside world. The responsibility of the Centre is to show the works with the status and respect they deserve, and to show other people Aboriginal culture, in a way that may educate them.\r\n\r\nOrigins\r\nEvery Aboriginal person comes from a creator being, known as wangarr, in this region. These spiritual beings took many forms, moving across the land and sea, forming and shaping the landscape.\r\nAs these beings travelled they imparted the 'life force' in that place for the Aboriginal people who were affiliated to that 'country' or land tract. They gave the people their langauages, songs, ceremonies, law, social customs, and technology. Always they wore the proper body ornaments and carried with them the life-giving rranga, sacred images of the wangarr, and girri, the wordly posessions each person needed for survival. They also gave each person/group their land." .
