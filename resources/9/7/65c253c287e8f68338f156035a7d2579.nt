<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/96bf50229bc7fcba97de30ecd121a30b> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "De figuur van de courtisane vult nadrukkelijk het hele vlak. Zij neemt tijdens het lopen - zoals het een courtisane van stand betaamt - een elegant achteroverhellende houding aan. Daarbij is alle aandacht geschonken aan de details van de verschillende kimono's die in hun bontheid schril afsteken bij het zwaar geblankette gezicht. Dat in deze schildering de compositie heeft geprevaleerd blijkt onmiskenbaar uit het weglaten van de draagster of drager van de paraplu. Behalve als bescherming tegen de vallende sneeuw is deze immers vooral een compositorisch vereiste. De zwarte baan brengt, in samenspel met de donkere onderrand van de kimono, de enigszins wankele figuur compositorisch in balans. Uit de pracht van kleding en de coiffure kan afgeleid worden dat een oiran, de benaming voor courtisanes van de hoogste rang, is afgebeeld. De sneeuw en het daarmee harmoniÃ«rende dessin van besneeuwde pijnbomen op de overkimono, duiden op de traditionele nieuwjaarsparade door de hoofdstraat van het vermaakcentrum van Edo, het Yoshiwara.\r\n\r\nEngelse tekst:\r\nLittle is known about Utagawa Kunihisa's life, but in this respect she differs little from the majority of the ukiyoe artists. The scarce biographical information - if indeed it may be called that - does not tell us much more than that she was a woman artist who studied with Utagawa Toyokuni (1769-1825). On the basis of the few prints she designed it may be concluded that she worked during the first ten or twenty years of the nineteenth century. Strangely enough for someone trained to make portraits of actors, she is known not only as a designer of prints but also and especially as a painter specialised in the bijinga genre, i.e., portraits of beautiful women. The painting of a strolling courtesan of course belongs to this category. The intensity that characterises this artist's portraits of actors is immediately recognisable here, albeit in another form. The figure of the courtesan emphatically occupies almost the entire space. As proper for a courtesan of high rank, she has assumed an elegant backward-leaning posture for walking. This posture allows accentuation of the details of her several kimonos whose bright colours contrast sharply with the white make-up on her face. The artist's preoccupation with composition in this painting is clearly shown by her decision not to include the bearer of the umbrella which was required for the composition more than for protection against the falling snow: its black border combined with the dark band low on the kimono brings the somewhat unstable figure into equilibrium The richness of the garments and the elaborate coiffure indicate that this is a painting of an oiran, a courtesan of the highest rank. The snow and the harmonising design of snowy pine trees on the outer kimono point to the traditional New Year's parade through the main street of the Yoshiwara, Edo's entertainment district.\r\n\r\nBeschrijving ivm ASEMUS VIRTUAL MASTER PIECES PROJECT\r\nUtagawa Kunihisa: Parading Courtesan\r\nIt must have taken months to finish this painting on silk of a parading courtesan in the snow. The high-class courtesan, most likely of the rank of an oiran, is wearing a brown overkimono, the lower part of which is decorated with snow-laden pines seen against a dark sky. From the neck of the kimono hangs a piece of material of a net-like construction ending in loose golden threads. She wears the overkimono low on her back, as is the custom with courtesans. Her red kimono has a decoration consisting in fans on a stippled sea-star pattern, each of the fans featuring flowers, such as irises, peonies, lespedeza, wisteria, etc. The obi, the wide sash which serves to tie the kimono on the front, has a pattern of curled dragons within green medallions. The utmost care was given to paint the white powdered face and the elaborate hairdo. After all this painstaking work, we can easily imagine the tension of the painter when the final touch had to be made: apply the snowflakes in white paint by splashing these onto the almost finished painting. Too much of this heavy pigment, made of ground shell, would no doubt ruin the painting. And yet, its application by splashing is hard too control.\r\nWhen viewing this painting, we can only conclude that Utagawa Kunihisa, the female painter, who studied with Utagawa Toyokuni (1769-1825), managed most successfully. Though initially trained to design woodblock prints of actors of the kabuki-theatre in role, Kunihisa is best-known for her paintings in the genre of beautiful women, such as this lady. Her servant who holds up the umbrella to protect her from the falling snow, is outside the design. Yet, she adds a wonderful compositional balance in the shape of the dark-rimmed umbrella.\r\n\r\nThis painting most likely purchased during the 1826 court journey in which Siebold partook.\r\n\r\nAdditional:\r\nPhilipp Franz von Siebold (1796-1866) was a medical doctor by training who entered into the service of the Royal Dutch-Indies Army, travelled to Indonesia where, recovering from illness, he attracted the attention of the Governor General at Batavia, Van der Capellen, as a suitable candidate for doing a similar research of the industries and products of Japan as Reinwardt had done in the East Indies. Therefore, his mission to Japan - where he would stay from 1823 to 1829, ending his career as accused of espionage and banned from the country for possessing secret maps - was largely of a colonial nature. In addition to his collections of plants and objects of natural history, he also made a collection of products of Japanese industry which he managed to sell to King William I after his return to Holland in 1831. He also obtained permission to keep his collection in the house he rented - and later bought - at Leiden, in order to use the material for compiling his major work on Japan, Nippon, in xx vols. 1832-185X. The collection was also opened to the public from about 1832. However, as soon as he received his payment, Siebold closed down his 'museum' and stored the collection in an unsuitable warehouse. It remained there until Conradus Leemans (1809-1893), the visionary director of the National Museum of Antiquities became in charge, when Siebold made a second journey to Japan in 1859. Leemans managed to almost immediately put the Siebold collection on display again, from the same year 1859. Later, he even managed to make it into an institution independent from the Royal Cabinet at The Hague, establishing the National Japanese Museum Von Siebold, which was later, in 1864, re-baptized into the National Museum of Ethnography, Leiden. That this was a well-deserved name will be obvious when we realize that the collection had, in the meantime, increased from some 5,000 items, to some 34,000.\r\nAfter the dissolvement of the Royal Cabinet in 1883, the ethnographic collections of the Cabinet were moved to Leiden.\r\n Cf objects from the Blomhoff Collection\r\n Cf objects from the Fisscher Collection" .
