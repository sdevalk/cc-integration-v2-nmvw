The manufacturing of\r\nthese objects is a monopoly of Tarfia, and the specimens which de Clercq found on Jamna\r\nand Liki, with the place of origin given as Tanah Merah, must therefore have originally come\r\nfrom Tarfia. The people of Tarfia also very often ornament themselves with belts, arm-,\r\nwrist- and brow bands of this make, (fig. 55), but derive great benefit from this monopoly,\r\nthe maintenance of which is of vital importance to them.  Other villages acknowledge Tarfia's\r\nexisting rights in this respect and war with these quarrellous people would irrevocably be the\r\nresult, if another village, even if it were only for its own use, dared to manufacture the same.\r\nOn the other hand every war in the neighbourhood, which interfered with the free intercourse,\r\nwould be disadvantageous to Tarfia." .
