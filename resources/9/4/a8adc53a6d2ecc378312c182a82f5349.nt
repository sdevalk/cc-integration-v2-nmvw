This particular example likely dates from the early 19th century, probably some time before 1821. Some records of similar dolls in other museum collections indicate that these types of dolls were made by ‘natives’. However, in all likelihood these dolls were made in South Africa by people of European descent. The earliest known examples were recorded as being made in 1812 by a Mrs Fronemann who gave them to the collector William Burchell. \r\n\r\nThese types of dolls are made according to the patterns typical of European dolls of the time. Unlike the more generic European dolls, these South African dolls appear to have been made specifically to represent indigenous South Africans. They appear to depict black and Coloured South Africans from a European perspective. This can be seen through the physical attributes and clothing of the dolls which match the contemporary European stereotypes of ‘primitive’ Africans. \r\n\r\nThese dolls are often attributed to specific African ethnic groups. Based on the clothing, this particular doll appears to be a depiction of a Khoikhoi woman. That said, attributions like this are not always reliable as the dolls may also have been intended to be a more general stereotypical representation of Africans.\r\n\r\nDolls like this one were taken back to Europe by travellers, missionaries, and soldiers as souvenirs of their time in Africa. In Europe, these dolls were sometimes exhibited in museums as representations of colonized peoples.\r\n\r\nIt is not known exactly when this doll came into the Netherlands. However, it is likely one of the dolls that were transferred to the Royal Cabinet of Curiosities from another Dutch collection in 1821. They are mentioned in archival documents from 1821 and visitors guides from 1824 and 1860. Note that many of the terms used in the following quotes are now deemed to be highly offensive slurs. \r\n\r\nArchival documents from 1821 mention the transfer of ‘[v]ier stuks afbeeldingen van Kaffers en Boschmannen. Onder twee stolpen’ to the Royal Cabinet of Curiosities. [Four pieces, depictions of Kaffers and Bushmen (sic) under two glass bells.] In 1824, they appear to have been exhibited at the Royal Cabinet of Curiosities located at Mauritshuis in the Hague. A contemporary visitor’s guide mentions ‘[a]fbeeldingen van Hottentotten, Kaffers, Bosjesmannen en [N]amaquas onder glazen stolpen; zoo als men die bij Sparman, Vaillant, Koll, S. Barrow, Campbell, de Jong, Lichtenstein en anderen beschreven vindt.’ [Depictions of Hottentots, Kaffers, Bushmen, and Namaquas (sic) under glass bells; such as one would find described in Sparman, Vaillant, Koll, S. Barrow, Campbell, de Jong, Lichtenstein, and others.'] A visitor’s guide from 1860 mentions ‘[a]fbeelding van Hottentotten en Kaffers.’ [Depictions of Hottentots and Kaffers (sic)]. \r\n\r\nThe other dolls mentioned in the archival documents likely correspond to RV-360-5804a, RV-360-5641 and RV-360-5642 (both since destroyed, though an accessory from RV-360-5642 still survives).\r\n\r\nThe Royal Cabinet of Curiosities, founded in 1816, was one of the first museums in the Netherlands open to the general public. Objects like this doll were influential in the creation of Dutch stereotypes of Africa and other parts of the world. The museum closed in 1883, and its collections, including this doll, was transferred to what is now called Museum Volkenkunde in Leiden." .
