<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/b6acc8c74dcbb6b8b282be5fc8acb857> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "British-American powderhorn with Cherokee strap; ca. 1760-1770\r\nCow horn, wood, cotton, glass, porcupine quills, hair, pigment; horn: l. 26 cm.\r\nRMV 924-82; purchased at H. Melges Auction, Antwerp, January 1893\r\n\r\nThe wide end of this engraved powder horn is closed with an inserted wooden disc. The narrow end of the horn has a wooden plug, carved in the shape of a heart. The carving is damaged. The strap is made of coarse cotton, on which the remnants of an Indian finger-woven band are sewn, most probably the original strap. The woven band is yellowish-brown between the black outer edges. Interwoven white pony beads form elliptic and zigzag patterns. The strap is attached to the powder horn with a fine porcupine quill-wrapped cord. On one end of the strap is a tassel of red-dyed hair.\r\n\r\nThe horn is engraved with a map of two rivers in Cherokee Indian Territory, along which twelve villages are situated, each indicated with the figure of a house and a Native name. Along River A, indicated by European house types are: Kittoah, Noocacee, Cowee, Ayotee, Sucroey, Ucsanah and Eechoey. Along River B, indicated by triple-domed houses or Cherokee style houses are: Tesantee, Allejoy, Natly, Tassee and Watoga. The names are those of Cherokee Indian villages on the Little Tennessee and Little Keowee Rivers in the 1760-1770 period. The map is enhanced by engraved figures of birds, flowers and a deer.\r\n\r\nPowder horns, often engraved with maps relating to the French and Indian Wars (1755-1764), were very popular in Colonial America and made by one of the many colonial Americans who served as scouts in the British army (Guthman 1999; Dresslar 1996). The horn in the Leiden collection was probably made by one of the many Colonial Americans who served in the British army. The engraving relates to a British military action in Cherokee Indian Territory in the spring of 1760. This same military force, the 77th Highlander Regiment, had been in action in western Pennsylvania in 1758, which may explain the remnant of quillwork on this horn. The woven strap and its beadwork patterns are not northeastern, and may well be of Cherokee origin. But Cherokees did not make quillwork.\r\n\r\nSpecimens like this are rare in European museum collections. A comparable powder horn is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City (cat. nr. 37.131.6), and engraved with a map entitled “The Middle Settlements of Cherokees.” It shows named villages on a river and the royal arms of Great Britain. The Museum of the Cherokee Indian in North Carolina exhibits an engraved powder horn tracing the route of Lt. Colonel James Grant in 1761 when his troops drove 5000 Cherokees from their towns, fifteen of which were completely destroyed (King 2007:plate 3; cf. Power 2007:64-67).\r\n\r\nTed J.
