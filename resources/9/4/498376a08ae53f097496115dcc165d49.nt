<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/54be0519e672023bb7adbecaed7ae54d> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This wooden stick is very likely a walking cane. \r\nIt is carved from one piece of wood. A snake is wound around it in spirals. On top, it has a small disc which probably served as a handle. \r\n\r\nThere is no information about canes or even older people generally in the literature. It can be assumed though that this stick served as a support for older or disabled people while walking." .
