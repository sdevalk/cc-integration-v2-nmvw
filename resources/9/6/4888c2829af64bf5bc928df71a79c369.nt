<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/cafdbe6cb22c1945c2af17ec0c4bc648> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This ceremonial dance ornament represents a white cockatoo.  Carved from wood the bird has a short beak and spread wings. The top is largely decorated with coix seeds and abrus pips. The eyes of the bird are also indicated by abrus pips. The parts without pips have been painted yellow. There are a few real feathers attached to the body, mainly on the sides and wings. On the bottom there is a hole to which a stick was attached by means of which the ornament was carried above the bearer's head.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\nAccording to the donor, children carried this object attached to a stick during the parade in honour of the marriage of Princess Juliana of the Netherlands.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\nThe bird ornament is a replica of the Basik-Basik clan emblem representing a totemic ancestor/animal, whose ritual significance and cultural symbolism are rooted in Marind mythology.\r\n\r\nI could not find any relevant information connected with the white cockatoo. Thought it might be not relevant I present information about the black cockatoo (kapiog). It is one of the biggest of all the parrot species found in New Guinea and belongs to the pig clan (Basik-Basik) of the Bragai-ze phratry.\r\n\t\t\t\r\nDehevai, literally \"shooting father\" (referring to the headhunting activity associated with Nazr, the pig dema (Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 51, Fig. 2) ) enters the mayo-mirav masked as a black cockatoo (kapiog). He wears \"a peculiar headgear made of sago-leaves and decorated with big, red-rimmed eye holes and black feathers.\" (Van Baal, 1966: 409). \"In one hand he holds a spear (dam, a javelin; cf. Geurtjens, Dict. voc. cit.), in the other the imbassum. ... a small [black] stone artefact, about 7 cm long, beak-shaped at one end and with a few notches near the other end for the strings by means of which the artefact is fastened to a stick ... to demonstrate its use as a [ceremonial] spear-thrower\" (ibid.: 413).\r\nThus Dehevai \"'shoots' his flashes, and this activity is symbolized by the black cockatoo performer who 'shoots' his javelin by means of a spear-thrower [imbassum], the instrument which once the thunder dema imprudently presented to a human being. ... The black cockatoo being the representative of the thunder dema in ritual, the name of the dema could also be applied to the animal and thus Dehevai could become a synonym for kapiog (ibid.: 414). \"...he wears a black cockatoo mask and holds a spear and a spear-thrower in his hand. He is the demon of the thunderstorm and of headhunting\" (ibid.: 531).  \"In the ritual Nazr [as Dehevai] is not a killer, but a headhunter and his bird, the kapiog, appears in the headhunting season\" (ibid.: 415). He appears at the conclusion of the ritual just before the start of headhunting raids.   \t\t\t\t\t                   \r\nIVANA HLADKA, 20.11. 2006" .
