<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-173-1> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Two-piece spear, with a hardwood head carved with ca. 18 'closed' barbs, suggesting a provenance of north-eastern Arnhem Land - Groote Eylandt. Hardwood head attached to main (probably bamboo) shaft with resin and (probably string) binding. Extremity of tip has either lost its barbs or is unbarbed (a feature not noted by Davidson, 1934).\r\nMuseum Register volume ('blue book') 1837-1869, entry for series 173, p.185, confirms that this spear was obtained by Piepers in Makassar, and that it originated in Australia with the 'Orang Marege' (Aboriginal people). So far as I know, this is the only known example of an Aboriginal object collected in Makassar from Macassans who visited north Australia annually to collect trepang or sea-cucumber for trading purposes." .
