It has a wooden head with a long nozzle and eyes indicated by abrus pips. The long wooden neck is on the top partly decorated with red feathers. The body is made from wood and sago-leaf stem, to imitate bird feathers, and tightened with rattan. There are also a few real feathers attached to the body, mainly on the sides. There is a hole in middle of the figure through which goes a long flexible stick (arib). Its upper part is bent and the bird's head is attached with a rope. The lower part goes through a wooden platform (humum) decorated with feathers on which the bird rests and which is attached to the bearer's head. Sometimes the head and the neck of the figure is from a real bird (Baal, J. van, 1938. Archive RMV, Leiden, series 2385).\r\n\"Perched on the top of his head, each [humum-ornament bearer] wears an animal figure, fastened by means of a long rod which passes right through the hairdo and the body of the animal and ends in a long plume. Slipped round the rod, below the plume, is a singsingi, a rattle consisting of a piece of bamboo filled with the hard kernels of some fruit. The animal figure is set off against a kind of nimbus, a construction of ribs of palm-leaflets dotted with down. The nimbus is called humum, literally cloud, clouded sky, and this name came to be applied to the whole show\" (Van Baal, 1966:855-856), humum-angai (TM-number: 5969-25). It is \"a show of richly decorated men combined with a dema-wir [Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 9] of some sort\" (ibid.: 829). \r\n\r\nVan Baal gives a description of one such ceremony: \"Now a long procession of fantastically decorated men and children approaches from the east. They were light, softwood images of birds, fishes and other animals, swinging to and fro at the end of the long elastic rods which rise above the humum, the elaborate, delicate structure of fragile laths lined with down and plumes which crowns their heads like a nimbus. Darkness has fallen now and the women surrounding them carry flaming torches. When they have arrived near the festive grounds, all kneel down, the iwag comes forward again and, beating the ground with croton-twigs, permits them to rise and enter the enclosure, where the dance goes on till daybreak\" (ibid.: 852).\r\n\r\nThis ceremonial dance ornament is the Kuna-hi Ndik-end (Yawima-rek) clan emblem representing a totemic ancestor/animal, an ibis bird whose ritual significance and cultural symbolism are rooted in Marind mythology.  The Ibis belongs to the totem-relations of the Aramemb phratry (Yawima-rek clan). \r\nYawima is one of the Marind mythological rain-magicians, dongan-anem (thunder-maker) and the ibis is a metamorphosis of one of his sons. According to the myth, one day Yawima found some of his sons drunken with wati and in anger he started to beat them with a stick. As a result of this his sons changed into various birds. One changed into an ibis, because he waddles like inebriated wati-drinker (ibid.: 288-289).\r\n\r\nWith reference to the ebob dance ornament, Wirz described the imo cult tik ceremony held at Elebeme. \"... Toward five o'clock six performers appeared, painted black from head to foot. In their hairdo they each had fixed a long, elastic rod (arib) with, on top, the black head of an ibis... . These dema-performers of the imo ... entered the village in pairs. ... With solemn paces they marched up and down, several times in succession, the long arib swinging above their heads. ... This went on all night, but before daybreak the performers... returned again with bullroarers. ... Then a great fire was laid in which all the discarded decorations were burned, so as to destroy even the last traces of sickness. ... They hoped that by now the tik had been definitely banned by chasing it into the sea\" (Wirz, 1922-25 III: 94f and van Baal, ibid.: 636-637). Van Baal suggests that the six performers with ibis decoration should not be called dema-performers, but ebob-ti (dancers with the ebob ornament).\r\nThe ibis decoration is typical of imo cult ceremonies. This also confirms another Wirz (M.A. III: 146-149) description of the imo mourning rite at Makalin. The main characters are three sobolu-ti (TM-number: 5969-48) (crowned with sobolu, cassowary-plumes decoration) and three arib-ti/ebob-ti (wearing arib with the head of a black ibis in their hairdo). While the old men sing yarut near the grave, the performers emerge from the bush and walk around the grave. They sing all together till the daybreak when the grave is re-opened. The corpse is cleaned with water and sperm and decorated with red pigment. Then the grave is closed again. \"Now the secret part of the ceremony begins ....\" (Van Baal, 1966: 793).\r\n\r\nIVANA HALDKA, 20.11. 2006" .
