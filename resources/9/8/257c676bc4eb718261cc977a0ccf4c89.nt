The Ongiara tribe that lived near the Falls offered the Spirit of the Fall every year a white canoe with a maiden and fruit in it. The girl steered the canoe down the waterfall. It was seen as a great honour. But one year the daughter of the chief was chosen. She too stepped in the canoe and went down the waterfall. It is said, however, that her father couldn't bear the thought of is daughter being sacrificed, so he went after her in his own canoe. \r\nOne story says that this tribe was conquered by another tribe that did not believe in the Spirit of the waterfall and ended the offerings. The maidens are still said to be seen at the foot of the waterfall. \r\nAnother story says that the offering was because of many people dying in the village and ends differently. The maiden is rescued by the two sons of Hinum, a thunder god, who live in a cave behind the falls. They want to marry her. She said she would marry the one that would tell her who killed all the people in her village. One of the brothers tells her it is a water serpent. In spirit the girl tells the village to kill the serpent. She then returned and marries the brother; she would reign as Maiden of the Mist.\r\nAnother legend says that the girl had to marry someone she didn't love, so she tried to kill herself by going down the falls in her white canoe. But she was caught by Heno the Thunder god. He took her to his cave and took care of her until she had the will to live again. Eventually she goes back to her village where she surprises everyone with her wisdom and patience, which were given to her by Heno. \r\n\r\nwww.infoniagara.com/attractions/legend.html (9-1-2007)\r\nwww.halinet.on.ca/GreatLakes/Documents/HGL/default.asp?ID=c005 (9-1-2007)\r\nwww.niagarafallsheritage.ca/heritage/show.asp?id=256563 (9-1-2007) \r\n\r\nPostcards\r\nTheme: Historical\r\n\r\nOne of the first European nations that colonized North America was Spain. In 1539 Hernando the Soto reached Florida. With him he brought priests to missionize the Indian population. Most of the priests were killed, but it was the beginning of European influence in this part of America.\r\nSoon after the Spanish arrived two other main players in the history of North America would arrive at the continent: England and France. At first these two nations were more interested in trading with Indians than to make Christians of them in contrast to the Spaniards.\r\nIn a lot of cases contact started with the fur trade. The trade had a huge impact on the way of life of the Indians. First of all tribes shifted from fishing and hunting to trapping bevers and otters. The most obvious change was contact with Europeans and their trade goods. Furs were traded for beads, ribbons and bells and later also for guns and other metal tools. Certain clothing acticles and designs were also adapted and copied by Indians. Altough Indians borrowed a lot from European traders they never fully shifted to European fashion and way of life. European designs, clothing styles and tools were simply adapted to traditional ways of life. Not everything European came to the Indians by trading. The horse for example was introduced by the Spaniards in the 17th century. Through the tribes of the Southwest they found their way through North America by trading and raiding. Especially for nomadic tribes this mobilization meant changes in living, hunting and warfare.\r\nEventually tribes started to become more dependant on the tradingposts and started to live nearby. The numbers of groups around the tradingpost became so large, that diseases started to break out. The loss of certain skills caused even more problems when the fur trade started to decrease in the 1830s.\r\nSoon the French and English were interested in more than furs. Farmers, priests and other people from these countries came to America to settle permanently. In the beginning they were outnumbered by the Indian population, and the only way to settle somewhere was by gaining the trust of the local Indians. But soon more, especially English, settlers came and conflicts over land began. Treaties were signed and broken or Indians were forcefully removed from their land if they resisted. Finally a many tribes ended up on reservations. During the American Revolution most Indian tribes took the side of England, though not all. This caused intertribal warfare. After the American Independence all defeted Indians were driven away to the western side of the Mississippi River. Later other tribes were removed from their lands and were also sent westward. But colonization did not stop and eventually colonists crossed the Mississippi. By means of pacification of Indians and the killing of bison the colonists made the Indians more dependent on the government. By signing more treaties, their land was taken and they were once again put in reservations. In 1887 the Allotment Act ended collective landownership. Land was now owned individually by Indians. Land that was left went to white farmers. More poverty among Indians was the result.\r\nMeanwhile the European priests had started their missions throughout the country. Indians were seen as savages and the priests believed that they should become Christians and live in a European way. The goal of the missions was to educate Indian priests and eventually to create Indian churches. \r\nThe missions also took the responsibility of teaching European agricultural methods and educating Indian children. Children were taken from their parents and put in boarding schools where they were forbidden to speak their language. They were educated in a European way and were mistreated very often. When they finished school they had to go back to their reservations. The result was that they could not adapt to the way of life in the reservations any more.\r\nThe consequences of the European invasion for the Indians were many. Some improved their lives, most of them only made life harder. In any case life changed but Indians never fully adapted the European way of life. Mostly they tried to cope with it and inserted it in to their traditional way of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nPieter Hovens: Indianen van Noord-Amerika (1977 Van Gorcum, Assen/Amsterdam) p. 52-56, 59-63, 65-67, 70, 72, 76-77, 81-82\r\nWilcomb E.
