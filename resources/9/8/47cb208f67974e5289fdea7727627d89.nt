<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-362-38> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "362-38\r\nPapago bull roarer; weehoow√≠kkaytuhkuh (TK); saguaro wood, pigments, cotton; l. of board 46.4 cm., w. 4.4 cm., th. 1.4 cm.; ca. 1880.\r\n\tTen Kate noted: \"this contraption is swung around at a quick pace and creates a strong humming. It is used to treat the sick to induce the spirits to provide healing.\" The bull roarer was carved in such a way that it produced a strong sound when it was swung around on a cord. The distal end was carved round and all sides are thinned to increase vibration. The board is covered with a foundation of white pigment, on which a series of connecting triangles in red are painted on the upper side, and a repeating meandering pattern on the underside. The cord attaching the board to the stick handle is made of twisted native cotton. According to Lumholtz who did fieldwork among the Arizona Papagos in 1909-1910, the painted triangular patterns symbolize clouds, the connecting lines lightning, and the dots corn, the sound and imagery of the bull roarer geared to attract rain for crops. In addition, the sound of the instrument announces both beginning and end of feasts and ceremonies (1912:88,95-96; cf. Fontana 1983:139). Although bull roarers play an important part in ceremonies of many Southwestern tribes, they are remarkably rare in archaeological contexts (Brown 19..:78-79).\r\n(Hovens 2009)\r\n\r\nBromhout, een rond stukje hout dat door middel van drie snoeren is verbonden met een ruw houten plankje met rode zig-zag strepen op witte ondergrond." .
