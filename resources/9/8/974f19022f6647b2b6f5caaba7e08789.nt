<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/983113ef5d2b2bea8af6eb26e60d5841> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This is a depiction of the god Hanuman, who is an integral part of the epic tale 'The Ramayana'. The story of the Rama, his consort Sita, and their loyal friend and helper Hanuman is widely read, reenacted, and part of worship across the Global Hindu diaspora. It is also a significant text in its localised versions across Southeast Asia. Hanuman is a monkey-god, which means he has simian-like features, which you can recognise most prominently by his face. In earlier depictions, he also has a tail. Throughout history, Hanuman's visual representation has shifted greatly--he has become less monkey and more 'masculine'. Here, you can see that Hanuman is leaning towards a more masculine figure, as he has defined muscles. However, in depictions in the 1990s and later, Hanuman becomes very chiselled, and has a physique resembling a body builder or weight lifter. \r\nHere, he is pictured with his mace, and in his open palm we see, written in Hindi, 'Sri Ram', an utterance of obeisance to Rama." .
