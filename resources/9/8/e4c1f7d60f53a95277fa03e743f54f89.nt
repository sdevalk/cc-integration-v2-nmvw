<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-362-37> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "362-37\r\nPapago bow and arrows; wood, sinew, feathers, obsidian; bow: l. 113 cm., w. 2.5 cm.; arrows: av. l. 86 cm.; ca. 1870-1880.\r\n\tWeapons were required for hunting as well as warfare, both defensive and offensive. Generally little effort was invested in making weapons for utilitarian hunting, while much more time and effort was spent on the manufacture of weapons of war, as this required maximum effectiveness and ritual observances during the production process. Both Papagos and Pimas preferred mulberry for their war bows, and gathered the wood in the Pinal and Superstition Mountains. Osage Orange and even willow was used for hunting bows (Russell 1903:95-96, plates 7b,13a).\r\n\tTen Kate noted that this bow is of a crude type, and that the arrowheads were made from obsidian, volcanic glass. The bow is ovoid in cross-section, and strung by twisted two-strand sinew. Both extremities of the bow exhibit remains of red paint. The arrows have notched and fletched ends, and foreshafts to which the points of volcanic glass are attached by sinew. Ten Kate acquired this set at San Xavier del Bac.\r\n(Hovens 2009)" .
