These dishes are usually oval, occasionally round, and a few have the shape of a halved ellipse. On one side there is knoblike extension, often with a hole to pass a loop through to hang up the dish. \r\nThe dishes discussed thus far range in diameter or length between twelve to thirty inches. They were household articles that were used daily by the women and remained in their possessions. Big ones (three or five feet long) were also made. These were owned by the ondoforo (chief) and were used to serve pork, the festive food for ceremonial occasion.  \r\nA great number of these dishes have the entire outer surface ornamented with  incised patterns. Those of another group are decorated with a simple figure dominating the surface. Four animal motifs were predominant and were interpreted by local people as a turtle, a Papuan hornbill, a lizard, and a frog. In each case the body was represented by a diamond-shaped or ellipsoidal figure filled with spiral ornaments. What made a figure specific to the individual species was the way in which the legs or wings are added. These animals probably represented the clan ancestor." .
