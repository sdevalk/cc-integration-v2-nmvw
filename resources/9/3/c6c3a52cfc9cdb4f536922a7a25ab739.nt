Het is van licht en donker hout, en plantaardige vezels gemaakt. Nadere gegevens over dit voorwerp ontbreken (geen inventariskaart). De voorsteven heeft echter de typische vorm van een 'nagega' kano (zie ook 4593-13). 'Nagega' werden vooral in het 'kula' gebied ten oosten van de Eilanden Gawa en Tubetube gebruikt, maar slechts op een aantal plaatsen gemaakt, waaronder Gawa en enkele dorpen op de Woodlark Eilanden (Malinowski 1922:144f.).\r\n\r\nThis canoe is made with a dugout hull which played the role of keel because it is submerged when the canoe is loaded. The hull is raised with sewn fiddles. The prow and the stern were decorated. It has a big sail. This kind of canoe was used in the whole Massim area, yet in Kiriwina and Vakuta Islands people used the masaw, smaller and lighter than the nagega (Campbell, 2002, 72-73). They measured between 12 and 15 meters long . They were constructed mainly in Panaeati (Louisiade) and in Muyuw (Woodlark Island). Their canoes were sold in the whole Louisade Archipelago for earthenware pots. They were also manufactured in Kitawa and Iwa (Trobriands), and in some villages of Milne Bay and of the mainland (Suau and Orado). The building of the canoes comprises also numerous magical activities needed to be performed.  They could transported thirty persons. It could launch on a long trip. \r\nThe canoes were decorated with prow and stern ornaments and a splashboard attached transversely behind it. Such adornment were only carved by the member of certain family. The prows of nagega canoes are entirely covered by relief carving but a plain, tablike projection at the tip is left to serve for the attachment of a separately made charm which are no longer produced today. They were mainly produced in the northern Massim island of Marua, where they are called munkuris. It have served a protective function, protecting the crew during  the kula voyages. Their presence on the bow always required an offering from the hosts.\r\nKula is a trading system linking the men of the Massim area together. It is based on the exchange of high-value objects, ‘’necklaces’’ made of red shell discs, trading to the south, and ‘’armshells of Conus millepunctus circulating in the opposite way. These objects acquired value when they travelled and when they are possessed by  men of renown. The exchange take place between two partners called karayta’u  in Kiriwina island. They are under mutual obligation to trade with each other, to offer protection, hospitality and assistance whenever needed. \r\nTo manage kula expedition many rites and spell must be performed firstly during the building of the craft in order to make it ‘’swift, steady and safe’’. Some are done to avert the dangers of sailing and also to make the partner’s mind soft and eager to give kula gifts." .
