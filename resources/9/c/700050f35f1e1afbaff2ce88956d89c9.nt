Structural ornamentation through groups of white weft stripes, composed of three units each, repeated regularly for most of the length of the three webs.\r\nSuperstructural: weft brocading or onlay technique - spot motif and selvage to selvage. No 'cross bar'. A little embroidery around the V-neck. Selvages joined by 'randa' work (cochineal red silk).\r\n\r\nFinely woven white cotton ground with groups of white stripes. Across the shoulder area a fairly wide brocaded pattern, in which birds, eagles, various animal shapes, zigzag lines, etc. - arranged in rows (mainly in cochineal red). Front side of huipil has further cross striped design motifs in lower half - double-headed eagles, plant forms and other units added - also introduction of other colours - coloured rows alternate with rows containing white brocaded units. Several colours have run badly during washings. V-neck not ornately finished.\r\n\r\nAcquired in 1951 ; present from Don Tom√°s (Thomas B. Mac Dougall)." .
