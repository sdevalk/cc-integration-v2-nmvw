Oral tradition describes the Husk Faces as an industrious people living on the other side of the earth, where they are always busy tilling their cornfields. They are associated with fertility and growth, but also control game animals and have the power to confer luck in hunting. Like other supernatural beings they require proper respect and protocol in their dealings with humans; they crave tobacco and love to eat popcorn and dumplings, which are ritually offered to them.\r\n\r\nThe masks are worn by the members of the Husk Face society, who impersonate these beings during private curing rituals, usually initiated by a dream of the patient, and more conspicuously during their public appearances at the Midwinter Festival inaugurating the New Year and the Green Corn ceremonies in spring, which celebrate the ripening of the corn. The digging sticks, hoes, and mush stirring paddles carried by the masked dancers stand emblematic of horticultural activities and the nourishment they provide. The Husk Faces also act as heralds of the False Face dancers during the latter’s processions through the villages in spring and autumn, and due to the strength and speed ascribed to them, they also take over the role of police during rituals (Speck 1949). \r\n\r\nAlthough donned by men during the ceremonies, Husk Face masks were traditionally manufactured by women, who were not only responsible for the cultivation of corn, but also produced a range of utilitarian objects made of cornhusk such as shoes, containers, or mats. While some Husk Face masks, especially among the Seneca, were made by twining, the preferred technique for the majority of known masks (including the present pair) was braiding. The inner husks of white corn were soaked to make them pliable and then tightly braided into ropes, which were wound and stitched together with husk fiber or twine in the likeness of a face, leaving openings for the eyes and mouth. The nose was either formed by attaching a husk-covered piece of corncob to the mask or worked out in relief. The face was framed with one or more rows of braids, into which bits of cornhusk were inserted to form a fringe of hair (Fenton 1987:54-59, 383-446).\r\n\r\nJust like the beings they represent, the masks are age-graded and sexed: Puffed cheeks and protruding features, for example, denote old age, whereas small husk knobs (“medicine drops”) attached to the eyes, nose, and fringe characterize female masks. Other decorations – especially on Six Nations Reserve, where a more “baroque” style of masks is sometimes favored – may include red-painted cheeks, eyebrows made of black felt, or even protruding tongues resembling the ones seen on False Face masks.\r\n\r\nLike the False Face masks and other artifacts related to traditional ceremonies, the Husk Face masks are today objects of contention: While masks without ritual blessing are still being produced for an outside market (and today also by male craftsmen), traditional Iroquois have undertaken concerted efforts to have these objects repatriated from museums and withdrawn from public display and circulation in an attempt to reclaim cultural copyright and authority over the management of their heritage. Most False Face and Husk Face masks that Olbrechts collected during his fieldwork were directly commissioned by him from the makers and were never meant to be used in a traditional ceremonial context. These masks are not on public display.\r\n\r\nSylvia Kasprycki\r\nJ.W. Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam N. Fenton, The False Faces of the Iroquois; University of Oklahoma Press; Norman, 1987. Frank G. Speck, Midwinter Rites of the Cayuga Longhouse; University of Pennsylvania Press; Philadelphia, 1949.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVolgens de Irokese bevolkingsgroepen leven de \"Corn Husk Faces\" in een vallei waar bosbessen groeien. Zij zijn verbonden met vruchtbaarheid en groei en geven de zaden van de gewassen die verbouwd worden. De \"Husk Faces\" symboliseren de landbouw van de Irokezen. De maskers van de \"Husk Faces\" worden gedragen tijdens de midwinterceremonie wanneer de gemaskerde dansers van de \" Corn Husk Face Society\" de geesten van de oogst verbeelden om het Nieuwjaar in te luiden. De maskers worden gewoonlijk door de mannen gedragen maar door de vrouwen gemaakt van geweven of gevlochten maïsbladeren. Deze ceremonie maakt deel uit van een cyclus van \"thanksgiving festivals\", om op verschillende momenten van het jaar te danken voor succesvolle oogsten en vruchtbaarheid. Veel tijd wordt besteed aan de voorbereiding en de feitelijke ceremonies zelf. Hoewel de festivals religieus van aard zijn maken feestelijke maaltijden en vermaak onderdeel uit van de activiteiten, met name in de namiddag en avond wanneer religieuze en sociale dansen worden opgevoerd." .
