The album is entitled ‘Aboriginal Australians’. It includes studio photographs which were made by the Kerry Studio between 1885 and 1894.\r\n\r\nDe Kerry & Co studio was een van de grootste fotografische studios in Sydney van 1890 tot 1917. Charles Henry Kerry (1857-1928) werd geboren in Bombala, New South Wales (zie biografische informatie). In 1874 ging hij werken met Alexander Henry Lemartinière’s studio in Sydney. In 1833 werden ze partners. Kort daarop ging Lemartinière er vandoor met het Kleine kapitaal dat Kerry verzameld had. Kerry moest alleen verder met de zaak. In het midden van de 1880-er jaren ging Kerry een nieuw partnerschap aan met C.D Jones en deed de onderneming groeien. Rond 1890 verliet Jones de zaak. Kerry zette zijn eigen studio op met de naam ‘Kerry and Co’. Ook in 1890 werd hij de officiële fotograaf van Lord Carrington, de gouverneur van New South Wales. Naast zijn portretwerk, aanvaardde Kerry ook een aantal overheidsopdrachten, zoals reizen doorheen New South Wales om Aboriginal-mensen, hun kampen en corroborees (ceremonieën) en zichten op de Jenolan Caves te fotograferen. \r\n\r\nHet werk van Kerry werd veel makkelijker gemaakt door de uitvinding van het droge plaat proces in Europa in 1878. Waar vroeger foto’s terplekke ontwikkeld moesten worden, konden ze nu meegenomen worden naar de studio en daar ontwikkeld worden. In 1898 opende hij een van de grootste commerciële studio gebouwen in 310 George Street in Sydney. Kerry pionierde wintersporten in Kiandra. Hij leidde ook een groep naar de top van Mt Kosciusko in de winter van 1896. Hij nam afscheid van de onderneming in 1913 om zaken te doen en mijnen te ontginnen. \r\n\r\nKerry and Co was een van de grootste producenten van postkaarten vanaf 1903 tot studio dicht ging. Kerry’s foto’s van New South Wales werden tentoongesteld in de 1893 Chicago International Exhibition. Hoewel zijn neef de zaak overnam, zorgde de groeiende competitie en de veranderde smaak ervoor dat Kerry & Co sloot in 1917.\r\n\r\nDe Kerry and Co. foto’s zijn niet het resultaat van een fotografisch oog, maar het werk van een aantal fotografen zoals George Bell van 1893 tot 1900, Harold Bradley van 1893 tot 1911, Willem van der Velden van 1907 tot 1911 en Charles Kerry zelf. Samen waren ze verantwoordelijk voor een studio product waar geen enkele individuele fotograaf erkend werd. \r\n\r\nThe Kerry & Co studio \r\nThe Kerry & Co studio was one of the largest photographic studios operating in Sydney from 1890 until 1917. Charles Henry Kerry (1857-1928) was born in Bombala, New South Wales (see biographic information). In 1874 he joined Alexander Henry Lemartinière’s studio in Sydney, becoming a partner around 1883. When Lemartinière absconded soon after with the small capital Kerry had gathered, Kerry was left to carry on the business alone. In the mid-1880s Kerry set up a new partnership with C.D Jones and made the business grow. Around 1890 Jones departed, and Kerry set up his own studio named ‘Kerry and Co’. Also in 1890 he was appointed official photographer to the Governor of New South Wales, Lord Carrington. In addition to his portrait work, Kerry took on a number of government commissions, including travelling through New South Wales to photograph Aboriginal peoples, their camps and corroborees and taking detailed interior views of Jenolan Caves. \r\n\r\nKerry's work was greatly facilitated by the invention of the dry-plate process in Europe in 1878. Where once photographs had to be developed on the spot, now they could be taken and developed later in the studio. In 1898 he opened one of largest commercial studio buildings at 310 George Street Sydney. Kerry pioneered snow sports at Kiandra, and led a party to the summit of Mt Kosciusko in the winter of 1896. He retired from the company in 1913 to follow his business and mining interests. \r\n\r\nKerry and Co was one of the largest producers of postcards from 1903 until the studio closed. Kerry's photographs of New South Wales were exhibited at the 1893 Chicago International Exhibition. Although his nephew took over the business, increased competition and changing tastes meant that Kerry & Co closed in 1917.\r\n\r\nIt should be stressed that the Kerry and Co. images are not the vision of any one photographic eye, but the work of a number of staff photographers, which included George Bell from 1893 to 1900, Harold Bradley from 1893 to 1911, Willem van der Velden from 1907 to 1911 and Charles Kerry himself. Together, they were responsible for a studio product where no individual credit was ever given.\r\n\r\n16: ‘Aboriginal Ceremony.
