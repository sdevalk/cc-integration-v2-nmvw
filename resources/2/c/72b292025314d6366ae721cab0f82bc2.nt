<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/5e7dc7b05d795fc9d8b26b29fd733666> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This painting shows us the hills at Argument Gap, a place east of Newry Station, which is just over the Western Desert border in the Northern Territory. It is outside the artist’s own country which she usually paints. She was inspired to do this picture after a trip by road with Warringarri Arts staff to Darwin for a meeting. There are very dramatic hills and long straight horizontal lines of rock which seem to cut right across he grassy parts of the hills. Some of the these horizontal lines have more vertical cracks  and colour changes as seen in the picture. The artist knew about the place and had been there before, but not for a long time. It is a place where the spirit woman, Ganggamerl, who set off from Red Butt in Queenie’s country, was killed in dreamtime." .
