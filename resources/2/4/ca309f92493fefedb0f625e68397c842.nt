<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/730dfb6e27f08480c3c08fd4457d0cde> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The jug consists of two parts, a jug and a supporting structure to carry it. The underlying structure of the jug is woven from rattan or other plant stems, which are entwined or woven together with a leaf strip. The long stem is laid in a concentric spiral which is tied together with leaves. It is bulbous and ends in a narrow neck with an outward rim. The woven basket is coated with a thick, moist mass of Parinarium to make it waterproof and leakproof. First, the inner side is coated, then the outer side. The basket is put in the sun to dry, where it gets its dark brown colour. The surface is then smoothened.\r\nThe supporting structure is made from rattan. The foot is plaited with rattan strips and so are the four rattan cords around the pot as well as the handle. \r\nThe manufacture was the job of the men. \r\nThe pot was used to transport and store coconut oil. The oil was part of the bride price or was paid to the family of a deceased person. In everyday situations, the oil was used in many ways for cooking." .
