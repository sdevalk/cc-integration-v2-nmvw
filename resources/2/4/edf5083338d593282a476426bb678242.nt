All the details of a crocodile's body are nicely worked out. It has patterns all over the body which are coloured brightly with red, white and black. \r\nThe crocodile in particular is one of the most important ancestral beings which created the earth and everything that is on it today. It is naturally closely associated with the water, which is considered the most important of the primal elements and in which the dead souls and ancestral beings dwell. The crocodile therefore represents an earthly link to the second world of the spirits, with which people constantly try to interact.\r\nThis kind of carving was hung up vertically on the gable of a men's house as decoration for a feast. When the ceremony was over, the figures lost their value." .
