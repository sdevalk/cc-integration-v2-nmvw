Biyun Temple is situated to the East of Mount Xiang Shan in Haidian District of Beijing. It was built up from Yuan Dynasty and is one of the most famous temples in Beijing.\r\n\r\nThe inscription on this stele tells the process of the reonstruction of Biyun Temple under the order of Emperor Qianlong and is written in both Chinese and Manchurian language.\r\nAccording to the title of year on both of the inscriptions, we also can tell they were inscribed in 1749, which was the title of  the year Qianlong Ji Si.\r\n\r\nThe other stele (1965-1) stands in the yard of  the Pagoda of Jin Gang Bao Zuo (Jin Gang Bao Zuo Ta) in BiYun Temple and the inscription on it recorded the building process of this Pagoda. The Pagoda of Jin Gang Bao Zuo is one of the Pagoda's forms which came from India. This kind of pagoda is based on a retangular high foundation on which five pagodas are set up. The four at corners are smaller than the one in the center. After introduced in China, the Indian form of  the pagoda of Jin Gang Bao Zuo took on many traditional Chinese style in structures  so as to become a creative work by  fusing Chinese architecture with foreign culture. The pagoda of Jin Gang Bao Zuo in Biyun Temple is one of the few pagodas of this form preserved by now in China.\r\n\r\nhttp://baike.baidu.com/view/637015.htm\r\nhttp://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A2%A7%E4%BA%91%E5%AF%BA\r\n\r\nJing Tan, 2008." .
