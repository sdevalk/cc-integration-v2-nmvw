Women manufactured such baskets. \r\nIt has the form of a pear with a narrow opening at the top. There are some leaves attached to the upper rim, which were probably used as a handle. \r\nAll kinds of goods and things cold be stored or carried in the basket. One possible usage could have been as a cage for a possum or other small marsupial, which were put in there alive and sold on the market." .
