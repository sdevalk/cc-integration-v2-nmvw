It is made from eight flat pieces of sago-leaf stem put together with rattan. The bottom is painted white and the top part is in dark colour with yellow dots. The sides are decorated with feathers. The flexible wooden stick (arib) is put through the hole and attached to the humum (a wooden platform made from sago leaf stem) which is placed on the performer's head. \r\n\r\n\"Perched on the top of his head, each [humum-ornament bearer (TM-number:5969-25)] wears an animal figure, fastened by means of a long rod which passes right through the hairdo and the body of the animal and ends in a long plume. Slipped round the rod, below the plume, is a singsingi, a rattle consisting of a piece of bamboo filled with the hard kernels of some fruit. The animal figure is set off against a kind of nimbus, a construction of ribs of palm-leaflets dotted with down. The nimbus is called humum, literally cloud, clouded sky, and this name came to be applied to the whole show\" (Van Baal, 1966:855-856), humum-angai (TM-number: 5969-25). It is \"a show of richly decorated men combined with a dema-wir [Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 9] of some sort\" (ibid.: 829). \r\n\r\nVan Baal gives a description of one such ceremony: \"Now a long procession of fantastically decorated men and children approaches from the east. They were light, softwood images of birds, fishes and other animals, swinging to and fro at the end of the long elastic rods which rise above the humum, the elaborate, delicate structure of fragile laths lined with down and plumes which crowns their heads like a nimbus. Darkness has fallen now and the women surrounding them carry flaming torches. When they have arrived near the festive grounds, all kneel down, the iwag comes forward again and, beating the ground with croton-twigs, permits them to rise and enter the enclosure, where the dance goes on till daybreak\"(ibid.: 852).\r\n\r\nDuring the mayo cult initiation ceremonies, the initiates imitate the flying foxes. \"In their hairdo they carry a long, elastic rod topped by a lustily swinging flying fox made of pieces of coconut husk and sago-leafstalks. ... A flower-stalk of the meri-coconut is fixed to the hairdo and their bodies are covered with coconut-leaves, ... . It is an enactment of the myth of Meru\" (Van Baal, 1966: 518-519) [about the introduction of the coconut (Van Baal, 1966: 254 f)].\r\n\r\nThe myths reveal the relationship between these creatures and young novices which have turned into flying foxes and flew overseas to bring flowers of a coconut. As a result of that, the mythical flying foxes themselves can change into coconut palm trees. According to Wirz this is a reference to the natural fact of  \"the symbiosis of flying foxes and coconut palm, of which they eat the young nuts\" (ibid.: 255).\r\n\r\nThe image of a flying fox can also be found on some taboo signs (sar-ahai), particularly those in the tabooed coconut garden. Therefore the ornaments of flying foxes are proper to the coconut dema (Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 34).\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 28.11. 2006" .
