This ceremony involved the placing of the deceased' s bones into a hollow log which was decorated with painted clan designs and ceremonially placed into the ground where it remained until it slowly decayed over many years.\r\n\r\nThe log is made from a termite hollowed Stringybark tree (Eucalyptus tetradonte) and is decorated with totemic emblems.\r\n\r\nThe Rembarrnga people whose clan lands lie between the Western Arnhem Land cultural block and the Eastern Arnhem Land 'Yolgnu' people are familiar with two variations of the lorrkkon ceremony.\r\nThe western Arnhem Land version of the lorrkon ceremony involves the singing of sacred songs to the accompaniment of karlikarli, a pair of sacred boomerangs used as rythm instruments.\r\nDuring the final evening of the ceremony, dancers decorate themselves with kapok down, or today, cotton wool and conduct much of the final segments of the ceremony in the secrecy of a restricted men's camp. The complete ceremony may stretch over a period of two weeks, but on the last night the bones of the deceased which have been kept in a bark container or today wrapped in cloth and kept in a suitcase are taken out, mpainted with red ochre and placed inside the hollow log. This ceremony may take place many years after the person has died.\r\nAt first light on the final morning of the lorrkon ceremony, the men appear, coming out of their secret bush camp carrying the pole towards the women's camp. The two groups call to each other using distinct ceremonial calls. The women have prepared a hole for the pole to be placed into and when it stood upright, women in particular kinship relationships to the deceased dabce around the pole in a jumping/shuffling motion. The lorrkon is then often covered with a tarpaulin and left to slowly decay. \r\nIn another version of the ceremony, the hollow log is made much shorter and the bones are crushed so that they will fit into the smaller container. This smaller hollow log is then buried vertically into a hole and covered over completely. Often personal clan designs which are also in other ceremonies are also painted on the hollow log.\r\n\r\nThe other version of the Lorrkon ceremony with which Central and Eastern Arnhem Land people are familiar is the bungkurl version. Bungkurl is a word used by a number of central and eastern Arnhem Land groups to describe a music and song style. In this style and unlike in the western version of the ceremony, didjeridu and clapsticks are used. Both versions have public and secret segments and are still performed in the central Arnhem Land area today, although infrequently. The bungkurl style lorrkon ceremony was documented in a film Waiting for Harry AIATSIS, directed by Kim McKenzie 1980, filmed at Gupanga, east of Maningrida).\r\n\r\nThese days, Aboriginal artists also make hollow log coffins for sale. The hollow logs are painted with the artists clan designs, although the designs are only given an \"outside\", or non-sacred interpretation." .
