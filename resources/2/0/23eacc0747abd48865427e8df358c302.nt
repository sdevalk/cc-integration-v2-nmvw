There is two men here and two women> The women story is underground. If people want meat or bush tucker they go to this place and clean around and talk to the area. From here these two women would go out and collect their food. They would carry a digging stick and collecting bowl and also fire stick. This painting is all the Piltati area.\r\n\r\nTjungu Palya:\r\nLocated about 100 kms south of Uluru, Nyapari is set at the base of the majestic Mann Ranges in the heart of country traditionally Pitjantjatjara people. These ranges known to Anangu as Murputja, likening the mountain to the bony ridge of a person's spine, are the source of many waterholes and traditional camping places. The homelands of Kanpi, Nyapari, Angatja, Umpukulu and Tjankanu have grown from these seasonal camping places into permanent settlements. Over fifty artists from Murputja joined together with family members living in traditional country 180 kms to the south at Watarru and created Tjungu Palya (Good Together).\r\n\r\nTjungu Palya is 100% owned and managed by Aboriginal people ensuring the wealth of talent and economic returns are retained in the community. Tjungu Palya promotes cultural integrity and the ethical sales of authentic art." .
