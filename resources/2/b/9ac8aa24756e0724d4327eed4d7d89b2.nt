At that time Nampeyo (1867-1942) was the only potter whose work was sold by name rather than the general moniker “Hopi.” Indeed, Nampeyo was the only Pueblo potter known by name until the 1920s.\r\n\r\n\tNampeyo excelled at all phases of pottery making; her exquisite aesthetic eye is easily comprehended. Her work birthed a new era of pottery at Hopi as well as throughout the Pueblo world. Nampeyo began potting at a period when the then current design aesthetic of pottery had played itself out; the shapes and designs were uninspired, repetitious renderings. Nampeyo gave her community’s pottery breath and life once again. Her experimentation and individuality in an era of plodding and uninspired pottery recreated Hopi and Hopi-Tewa pottery as well as ushered in the Native art market.\r\n\r\n\tNampeyo began making pottery at a young age.  She most certainly learned from an older female relative whose identity is somewhat in dispute. Like all Pueblo potters, Nampeyo harvested her own clay, cleaned and processed it, and used paints from organic and mineral sources. Her technical skills too were unsurpassed. She located new clays and paints; painstakingly experimenting with their qualities to mold under the naturally dry conditions of Hopi, to allow paint to adhere to its surface, and its durability to not pit or crack during firing.\r\n\r\n\tHer work is well formed with superbly applied paint and meticulous line and intriguing and unique designs. Her artistic and technical skills surpassed those of her contemporaries. Besides forming and decorating pottery with distinct talent, Nampeyo and her husband Lessou located clays of varying characteristics. She used five different clays; she was clearly interested in the technology and minutiae of clay and ceramics.\r\n\r\n\tThe designs are a combination of ancient and modern, but all are revelatory interpretations of Hopi pottery and the ancestral pottery of Northern Arizona (cf. Fewkes 1919). The symmetrical form is a two-headed bird, its distinctive tail at the bottom of the bowl. The bird’s body is filled in with plant, feather, seeds, prayer stick and corn symbols. There is a line break on the enclosing band. Some suggest this break is included to allow the “spirit” of the maker leave the pot, returning to the maker to be used in the construction of her next pot. Nampeyo did not ordinarily include a line break on her pottery, The painting style suggests that one of her daughters may have painted the bowl while Nampeyo molded it.\r\n \r\n\tNampeyo began to have eye trouble from glaucoma by about 1908, and within about ten years was blind. Some suggest that she concentrated on forming pottery as her eyesight deteriorated, leaving future generations to debate what her hand was as compared to that of the daughters that assisted her with pottery making. In Nampeyo’s earlier work she exulted in painting and creating new ideas. By 1900 she worked with her daughter Fannie; there is considerable discussion about her blindness and which daughter did how much of the pottery making. Notably, Nampeyo’s concern about authorship did not mirror the non-Hopi’s world ideas. Making pottery is a communal activity, and certainly Nampeyo worked with her daughters as she had worked and learned from her female relatives. It is clear that she continued to make pottery with her eyesight compromised and when complete blindness set in, her daughters Annie and Fannie painting the family’s pottery.\r\n\r\n\tHopi is built on community values; people are instructed to be Hopi and not individuals. Nampeyo’s experimentation with new pottery forms and her relationships with the outside world made her an individual and the most famous of all Hopis. But she was Hopi-Tewa and not even Hopi, speaking Tewa all her life and living at Hano, an immigrant village on the Western face of the Hopi mesas occupied about 1690 by Tanoan refugees from the Pueblo Revolt. They were granted land in exchange for their military prowess. Nampeyo lived a humble life; helping to pay for ceremonies and unselfishly teaching and encouraging other potters the new forms and designs. Nonetheless, given this history it is all the more remarkable that she had the impact she did on Hopi. Her life and work has deservedly been the focus of increasing research (Kramer 1996; Blair 1999; Wade 2012).\r\n\r\nBruce Bernstein; Coe Foundation for thr Arts\r\nSante Fe, NM; 2015\r\n\r\nMary Ellen and Laurence Blair, The Legacy of a Master Potter: Nampeyo and Her Descendants; Treasure Chest; Tucson, 1999.

Deze naam is afgeleid van het laat-prehistorisch aardewerk Sikyatki Polychrome (1375-1625) wat door de voorouders van de Hopi werd gemaakt. Tijdens het laatste decennium van de 19e eeuw lieten Hopi en Hopi-Tewa vrouwen van First Mesa zich inspireren door de vormen en decoraties van dit oude aardewerk. Dat werd mede verorzaakt doordat handelaar Thomas Keam daarvoor een markt zag en de archeoloog Jesse Walter Fewkes de nederzetting Sikyatki blootlegde en er veel aardewerk aan het licht kwam dat de pottenbaksters zagen. Nampeyo (Hopi-Tewa) nam daarin de leiding maar werd spoedig gevolgd door andere vrouwen toen het ceramiek goed werd verkocht. Zij was echter de meest kundige en demonstreerde haar vaardigheden aan bezoekers van de Grand Canyon en tijdens grote beurzen in de grote steden.\r\n\r\nSikyatki Revival stijl aardewerk is overwegend polychroom, rood of geel-wit. De decoratie bestaat overwegend uit figuren met ronde en golvende lijnen, passend bij de smaak uit de Art Nouveau periode. Veel voorkomende figuren zijn veren, regenwolken en kachinas, alle geassocieerd met vruchtbaarheid. Een innovatie was de vaas-vorm, vaak als tulpenvaas aangeduid.\r\n\r\nVanaf 1920 ging de kwaliteit van het Hopi-aardewerk snel achteruit door de nadruk op massaproductie. De School of American Research (Santa Fe) en het Museum of Northern Arizona (Flagstaff) hebben een belangrijke rol gespeeld in het op een nieuw kwalitatief niveau brengen van het Hopi aardewerk door hun aankoopbeleid, het uitgeven van een kwaliteitskeurmerk en het organiseren van gepremieerde wedstrijden voor pottenbaksters." .
