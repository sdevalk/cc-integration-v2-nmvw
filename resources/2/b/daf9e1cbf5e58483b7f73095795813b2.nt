De vrouwen, weergegeven door de U-vormen, reisden later oostwaarts naar Pinari, dat ten noorden van Kintore ligt. In mythologische tijden reisde een man van de Tjakamarra skingroup vanuit Kampurarrpa in het oosten naar deze plek. In Umari had hij een verhouding met een vrouw van de Nangala skingroup. In de Aboriginal samenleving is dit een taboe omdat zij zijn schoonmoeder zou kunnen zijn.\r\n\r\nThis painting depicts designs associated with the travels of a group of senior women from the rockhole site of Umari, east of the Kiwirrkura Community. The women, who are represented by the ''U'' shapes, later traveled east to Pinari, north of Kintore. In mythological times a man of the Tjakamarra kinship subsection travelled to this site from Kampurarrpa in the east. At Umari he had a liaison with a woman of the Nangala kinship subsection, that is mother-in-law relationship. In Aboriginal society this is considered taboo.\r\n\r\nDESERT ART\r\n\r\nThe inland of Australia consists mainly of desert. For thousands of years the Aborigines have wandered in small family groups through these immense plains as hunters and food gatherers.\r\n\r\nGovernmental policy\r\nIn the fifties and sixties, groups of Aborigines were put together in governmental settlements. The stated intentionÂ·was: 'to keep the Aborigines under control, tor the sake of their development'. In these 'communities' the government provided some facilities like concrete houses and schools. Some health-care and employment was organised and welfare payments, since traditional food collecting was limited. Residents could only leave their community with the permission of white Australians. When settlements became overpopulated, people were transported with trucks to other settlements. This did not happen out of free will, but was forced. The result was that Aborigines sometimes walked back hundreds of kilometres, whereupon they were once more taken back by truck.\r\n\r\nThe Papunya settlement\r\nIn the seventies a few tribes were forced to live together in Papunya. In 1971 a white art teacher, Geoffrey Bardon, came to their school. He became interested in traditional painting through his contacts with older Aborigines. The school in which he taught was a concrete building that could use some colour. A mural painting was made by the Aborigines with the traditional designs. After several experiments they started to paint on canvas. Acrylic paint seemed an excellent choice in this dusty area because the paint dries quickly. From Papunya the art movement extended to the other settlements each community developing its own, distinctive style.\r\n\r\nThe paintings\r\nMost of the paintings consist of dots and circles. The men were the first to transfer to the acrylic-canvas medium. Their work is highly symbolic: representing ancestral history and nomadic routes. The paintings often look like maps, seen from the sky. Only a person with considerable knowledge of the depicted locations and the dreamings related to them can understand the symbols properly. A circle may represent a campsite, waterhole or fire. More and more women have started to paint in recent years. Their subjects often have to do with the search tor and the preparation of food. They are also inspired by ceremonial body-paint designs." .
