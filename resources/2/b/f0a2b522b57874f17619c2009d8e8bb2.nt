<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/ab66d5ac14a8299505258c5d75dc0d09> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This painting is of a female Mimi spirit performing a ceremonial dance in the caves of the rocky sandstone Arnhem Land Plateau.                                                                                 The mimi are usually benign, shy spirits which flee at the approach of intruders in their rocky domain..  ..   .. blowing on the rocks which open and allow them to go inside. Clever men sometimes befriend the mimi and are taught their songs and dances and shown their secret places. The mimi are like people ..  ..  ..  using the same kinship terms and speaking the same language as the local Aboriginal group.                                                   They are, however, terribly thin ..  .. .. having necks so slender that a stiff breeze would be fatal. For this reason they emerge only on windless days and nights to hunt.                       Many stories are told of the mimi as people sit around their campfires at night. The exploits of the mimi are often used as a means of talking about scandalous behaviour without pointing directly at the miscreants within the group." .
