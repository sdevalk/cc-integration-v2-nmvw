Mosquitos came from long way, then mosquitos and King Brown snake started get jealous of each other about the country Malnyanganak. Mosquitos killed King Brown snake and chopped off her head bit. Then mosquitos took the King Brown snakes to a place Called Malnyanganak.\r\n\r\nPeople were enjoying themselves dancing, singing and clapping. They were singing a song called Langurr (Mandaiyala) which everybody can do. It is a men's dance. But while they were dancing , two Rainbow (Wititj) snakes started listening to them, where they making their dance. The two Rainbow snakes were very very at them. The Rainbow snakes had destroyed them, they went back to their country called Dombo. \r\n\r\nWhen rainbow snakes went past to a place called Manbun. Everybody will starting to have Manbun (but Manbun is a boil). Rainbow snake put it all in a dreaming, culture and named the place also they named placed called BALNGARRA.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAMINGINING\r\nRamingining is a small community of around 590 people, of whom about 30 are non-Aboriginal people, mostly advisors or teacherrs of some sort or another. The village itself is located some 400 kms to the east of Darwin, and nearly 30 kms from the Arafura Sea. It is a relatively new settlement, having only been established in the early 1970's. \r\nRamingining is situated upon the richest bauxite deposit (outside Nhulunboy) in Australia, possibly the world. The missionaries realised this and deliberately established the community at the present site to thwart mining company develeopment and associated problems as present in Nhulunboy.\r\n\r\nEarlier, in the 1960's an outstation of Milingimbi was set up at Nangalalala [ 8 kms N/E of Ramingining], a kilometre or so from the Glyde River. Ther older settlement Milingimbi Mission, was established in 1926 and is in fact situated on an island a few kilometres off the north Australia coastline. Nangala is still in existence, and is now considered an outstation of Ramingining.\r\nThe area around Ramingining on the mainland is home for the Djinang speaking Wurrkigenydjarr/Marrangu, Wulaki, Mildjingi, Balmbi and Murrungun clans.  In a wider circle are the Burarra, Rembarrnga, Wudamin, Ganalbingu and Manharrngu peoples. To the north are the Gorryindi, Gamalangga, Malarra and Walamangu peoples who look after the Crocodile Islands. Other people who live there and have ceremonial connections are members of the Gupapuyngu, Djambarrpuyngu, Wagilag, Liyagalawumir and Liya-gawumirr groups.  \r\nThe particular tract of land upon which Ramingining township is built is owned by the Djadawitjibi people, of the Djiang group. Their principal creative being is Garrtjambal, the kangaroo.\r\nSome 10-20 kms to the south of the village of Ramingining, where the looping Glyde River becomes the Goyder, is the large Arafura Swamp. Some 250 sq kms in area, this unique fresh water environment is home for an innumerable variety of water birds (including gurramatji, the magpie goose), fresh water plants, fields of water lilies, crocodiles, water snakes, insect life, and the magnificent and rare Corypha elata palm. (hundred year palm?).\r\nRamingining is situated upon the richest bauxite deposit (outside Nhuunboy) in Australia, possibly the world. The missionaries realised this and deliberately established the community at the present site to thwart mining company development and associated problems as present in Nhulunboy.\r\n\r\nThe Art\r\nThe art of Ramingining has always been highly prized and is still today pursued by some of the best known living artists in Arnhemland Land. However until the 70's, when the settlement of Ramingining was established, most of the art work of this area was circulated to the outside world either through the Art Centre at Milingimbi, or the Government settlement of Maningrida, some 80 kms to the west towards Darwin.\r\nNow the Art Centre at Ramingining has come into its own; somewhat ironically, it now services the older settlement at Milingimbi. The result of this change in the last decade is that now all art is chanelled beyond the region of its production through the Ramingining community's own Art Co-operative, Bulabula Arts.\r\nThis is a locally owned and controlled artists co-operative whose role is to 'market' the work of local painters, weavers, and sculptors to the outside world. The responsibility of the Centre is to show the works with the status and respect they deserve, and to show other people Aboriginal culture, in a way that may educate them.\r\n\r\nOrigins\r\nEvery Aboriginal person comes from a creator being, known as wangarr, in this region. These spiritual beings took many forms, moving across the land and sea, forming and shaping the landscape.\r\nAs these beings travelled they imparted the 'life force' in that place for the Aboriginal people who were affiliated to that 'country' or land tract. They gave the people their langauages, songs, ceremonies, law, social customs, and technology. Always they wore the proper body ornaments and carried with them the life-giving rranga, sacred images of the wangarr, and girri, the wordly posessions each person needed for survival. They also gave each person/group their land.\r\n\r\n\r\nARNHEM LAND\r\n\r\nIn Western Arnhem Land, in the north of Australia, a great sandstone plateau is located. Here we find many caves with rock paintings. According to archaeologists, some of these images have been there for 18.000 years. Apart from images of plants, animals and people, also the mythological ancestral creators are depicted in the shape of the Rainbow serpent, the Crocodile and Mimi spirits. Images painted in the X-ray style date back 3.000 years.\r\n\r\nThe images that are painted nowadays still have the same subjects as the prehistoric creations. During the wet season, bark is peeled from the trunk of the Eucalyptus tree. It is subsequently treated and then painted with natural paints like red and yellow ochre, chalk or white clay and charcoal, mixed with a binder. The background of the artwork is painted in one uniform colour or in geometric patterns. The images are painted in x-ray style: not  only is the visible outside painted, but the skeleton and the internal organs as well. Parts of the painting are filled in with cross-hatched patterns, which correspond to the pattern of the body painting used during ceremonies.\r\n\r\nMimi spirits often play a part in these paintings. They are match-thin magical beings who used to inhabit the land during the Dreamtime and passed on their knowledge to the first Aborigines. They are timid and shy and during the day they hide in crevices. Together with their playmates, the goanna (lizard), echidna (hedgehog) and the file snake they appear at night to go hunting, fishing, to sing and dance and to hold ceremonies." .
