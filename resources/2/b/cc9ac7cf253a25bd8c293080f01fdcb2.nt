It is not clear from the picture though as it could also just be dyed black. The cord is then taken into a bundle with 30-40 windings. On two places, the cords are tied together with a braid from black cotton strips. These are knotted in the front to close the belt.\r\nThese cord belts are primarily worn by women to hold up the bark-cloth aprons. \r\nThe black colour could be a hint that this belt is worn by a widow as part of the mourning attire. In this case, it is combined with black cords which are worn across the chest between armpit and shoulder or special coated belts which are worn in the same manner. Sometimes the body is painted white and black leg and arm cuffs are worn additionally. There is also a special cylindrical headdress which could be worn by the mourning person. \r\nThe period of mourning would last two to three months and had to be closed with a feast at which pigs were given to the widow. After that, the woman was allowed to remarry. The period of mourning was a special time when the widow or the widower, but also the whole community had to adhere to a certain conduct of behaviour which touched the sphere of food, clothing, language and ceremony. The adorning of the body is a visible sign of mourning." .
