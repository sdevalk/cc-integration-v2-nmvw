A very similar container was collected in Tonga during Cook’s second or third voyage. La Billardière explained at great length that coconut oil perfumed with the seed of the ‘langa kali’ was very much favoured by Tongan women in order to have a smooth skin. Although a few scented coconut oil containers were collected during the expedition’s stay in Tonga, there is no mention of the bird shape type held in the Leiden collection (Figure 4). \r\nLeiden’s Buyskes collection includes two fibre containers. One (RV-34-22) is described as ‘a tool basket’.  Similar examples were collected during Cook’s voyages. These types of baskets were probably used to hold freshly caught fish.  The second fibre container (RV-34-23) is made of four pieces of coconut sheath sewn together to form a long bag with a rounded end. Buyskes’s list describes it as ‘wooden weaving’." .
