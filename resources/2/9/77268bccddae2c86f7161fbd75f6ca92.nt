<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/3454accceb1167983d54852215e1cc2d> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This drum is made of a tree log and is evenly round in diameter. On the top there is a slit which is almost as long as the drum itself. It has two handles on the sides. \r\nThe log is hollowed out through the slit. The handles have the shape of crocodiles' heads. Along the slit is a carved line of triangles which are alternately painted white and black. The body of the drum is coloured in three sections red, white, red. The discs at both ends are coloured red with a black circle in the centre and four white lines to the outer edge. \r\nDrums were always played in a group. The drums of one group had different sizes, varying from 50 cm up to 3,50 m in length. There was only one such a large drum in every set and several smaller ones such as this exemplar. It was only the men and boys who were allowed to play the drums, which they did sitting on the ground in front of them and beating the drum near the end of a slit with a wooden club. Only the large drums were put upright and played while standing. Every man beat in a different rhythm and in different intervals thus creating a complex melody or song, which all have names. The melodies were short and started in a slow pace increasing the tempo towards the end. Due to the size of the drum and thickness of the wood, the drums were tuned in different pitches.  When not played, the drums were kept in the men's houses or special drum houses. \r\nThe beating of the drums is primarily associated with remembrance ceremonies. The widows mourn with loud lamentation when the drums fall silent. One single beat, the death beat, is produced by the widow and it is the only time a woman beats a drum in her life. However, they are also played on joyful occasions as an accompaniment to the dancing. \r\nThe second usage of the drums is as an instrument to communicate messages. Like Morse signals, whole sentences can be beaten and heard up to 8 miles in the distance." .
