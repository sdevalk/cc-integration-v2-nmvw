<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7106-84> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This painting shows Flying Fox Springs near Cowboy Knob in the artist’s traditional country just over the Northern Territory border from Western Australia. There are two main springs in the area. In the dreamtime a man passed the area and said that one spring (shown at the left) should be for the old people and one for the young people (shown at the right). Large numbers of flying foxes roost in the trees around these springs. In the early days people would light the brush on fire and some of the flying foxes would drop out of the trees. In the painting the artist has shown the smoke from the fires in yellow rising form the springs. The people would gather them up and roast them in an earth oven under paperbark. They are “good tucker”. The white line at the centre of the painting is Flying Fox Creel and the semicircular motif on the right is a crocodile nest full of eggs which are shown as yellow circles.\r\n\r\n(N.B.Picture in this database is shown upside down and with different colours)" .
