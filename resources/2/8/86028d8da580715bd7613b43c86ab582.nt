<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-IB-U-V80.069> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The Artist\r\n\r\nNamadbara was born about 1890 at Cooper Lagoon on the Cobourg Peninsula, north-west Arnhem Land.\r\n\r\nAfter the white buffalo-shooter Joel Cooper came to Cobourg and established a base camp at Cooper Lagoon,Namadbara's father worked for Cooper for many years. The artist was a childhood playmate of Cooper's part-aboriginal son Reuben, and as a lad, became a skinner for Joel on Melville Island for some years after Cooper began shooting buffalo there, from 1905. Namadbara later graduated to the jof of horseback buffalo-shooter, at which he became highly expert.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 Namadbara and his friend Midjaumidjau walked down the Pensinsula to the cattle station at Oenpelli near the East Alligator River to get tobacco. This coincided with the visit to Oenpelli by Baldwin Spencer, who was then Australian Government's Chief Protector of Aboriginals in the Northern Territory. At Oenpelli Namadbara and other men painted some significant pieces on bark for Spencer, which the latter subsequently exhibited and published without identifying the artists.\r\n\r\nMy discovery of Namadbara's role during the Spencer visit is dealt with in my forthcoming book.\r\n\r\nNamadbara went on to work as a timber-cutter for Reuben Cooper until the latter's untimely death in 1942.\r\nHe then worked as a hide-salter for another white buffalo-shooter on the Cobourg Peninsula, and later worked for a part-Aboriginal timber-cutter.\r\n\r\nAbout 1950 he moved to Croker Island. In 1968, feeling ready to die, he moved back to his home country on Cobourg Peninsula. He is buried there.\r\n\r\nThe painting\r\n\r\nThe artist has shown three mimi spirit-women dancing. He explained that because mimi have very thin, supple bodies, far more pliant than human bodies, he has shown the mimi bending about as they dance.\r\n\r\nMimi venture forth only on still days. When the wind blows, they remain in their habitats among the rocks for fear their long, thin necks may snap in the breeze.\r\n\r\nThe dancing spirits are shown being accompanied by a male mimi blowing a didjeridu, together with a mimi song man cavorting as he sings and beats his clapping-sticks.\r\n\r\ncopyright Lance Bennett" .
