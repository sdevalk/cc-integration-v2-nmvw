Here, we see the visual language of devotion to Rama alongside that of Vishnu.\r\nThe main figure, depicted in the middle, is that of Hanuman, the monkey-god who is a loyal devotee and helper of Rama, most popularly described in the epic Ramayana tale, that is hugely popular in South Asia, its diaspora, and in localised forms in Southeast  Asia. Around Hanuman are avatars of Vishnu. From left to right:  Varaha, Parashurama, Naramsimha, and possibly also another version of Varaha.  Inside Hanuman's chest are Rama and Sita. The image of Hanuman with Rama and Sita in his heart is a symbol of his undying devotion and loyalty to him. It is also a highly popular image." .
