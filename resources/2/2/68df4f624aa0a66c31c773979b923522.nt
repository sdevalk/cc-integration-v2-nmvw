People were now able to actually visit and see the Indians themselves. To promote these kinds of trips companies used stereotypes known to people.\r\nWith this card the Trans World Airlines is promoting their flights to New Mexico and Arizona, to what the call \"Indian Country\". They tell travellers about the Indian handicrafts, pueblo dwellings and colourful ceremonies. There are all kinds of Indian signs and of course a very colourful Indian on the post card.\r\nTo encourage people to use their imagination they depicted an Indian well known to most of the tourists. The Indian of the Wild West movies, colourful, grim faced and with a lot of feathers. This is however an Indian from the Plains and not a Pueblo Indian.\r\nThe Trans World Airline used the popular image of Indians most tourists have, to promote their flights to \"Indian Country\".\r\n\r\nPostcards\r\nTheme: Present-day (20th century)\r\n\r\nBefore European contact most North American tribes had little or no contact with other tribes. They were seen as outsiders and not regarded as humans. This started to change when the Europeans set foot in North America. Around 1700 alliances and confederations of different tribes were formed in the East. They began to see the European invaders as different from themselves. On the Plains the mobility of the horse increased contact between the different tribes. This was the begining of Pan-Indianism. Soon a new identity of “Indian” was created.\r\nWith it also came Pan-Indian religion such as the Native American Church and the Shaker Religion. This Pan-Indianism would be an important factor in the Indian resitance of the 1960s when several different groups would join together in action.\r\nIn 1934 the Indian Reorganisation Act replaced the Allotment Act. Collectively holding of land was restored and tribes were treated as equal partners. The Act also provided better education, healthcare and freedom of religion. Unfortunately the start of World War II ended funds necessary for these projects.     \r\nDuring World War II Indians began to migrate to the cities hoping to find work there in the war industries or as a soldier in the army. In the 1950s the government started assimilation, termination and relocation policies. By terminating reservations the government tried to assimilate the Indian population. The Termination Bill of 1953 failed and development programs like those of befor World War II replaced the termination. Relocation was an other policy. Migration to cities was seen as a positive factor in the assimilation of Indians. The BIA started a program to speed things up. Indians were trained and helped with finding employment. But because of discrimination and failing to adjust to the city many Indians returned to the reservations.\r\nOn the reservations unemployment continued to increase. Education levels were low and education was mostly provided by non-Indian schools. Their education programs focused on the savageness of Indians, giving Indian students a low self esteem.\r\nHousing was bad; there was no electricity, water or gas. Healthcare was also a problem. Indians were disciminated in hospitals and had bearly enough to eat. Alcohol abuse increased and with that also criminality. Indians were more often send to prison for drunkness than non-Indians. They were often abused in jail and suicide was not uncommon.\r\nThe 1960s were marked by Indian resistance. They wanted the responsibility for education and tried to get attention for the broken treaties. In 1972 members of several tribes marched to Washington. The “Trail of Broken Treaties” ended with the occupation of the BIA. \r\nUrban Indians were by now well settled in the cities and started their own Indian centres. These organisations wanted the Indian cultural and legal status acknowledged. Especially young people were involved in organisations, like AIM. In 1973 AIM occupied Wounded Knee to draw the attention to several murders of Indians that were not investigated by the FBI. The occupation ended with a promise from the government that they would investigate the treaties more carefully and allow more Indian involvement in Indian policy.\r\nIndians today want more autonomy in education, healthcare and housing. They want to continue living in ways that best suit them by using non-Indian institutions and technology the way they see fit.\r\n\r\nPieter Hovens: Indianen van Noord-Amerika (1977 Van Gorcum, Assen/Amsterdam) p. 88-94, 100-107, 111-117\r\nAlan L.
