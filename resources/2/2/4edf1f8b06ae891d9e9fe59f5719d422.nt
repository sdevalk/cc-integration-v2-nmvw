However, two related albums of paintings by Sunqua turned up in a sale at Sotheby's in London in 2001. They contained 22 paintings on pith costume studies of Spanish colonial and Peruvian dress, dated 1839. The images were titled in Spanish. One particularly interesting feature of these pictures is that the feet of the people and horses cast a shadow on the ground. Most paintings on pith have no such shadows, for the good reason than the painters did not follow the Western practice of showing the light flowing into the picture from a particular direction. No directional light, no shadows. Earlier paintings by Sunqua have no shadows, whereas in the series at Kew on the preparation of pith, feet, chair legs and all objects on the ground cast shadows. Perhaps copying these South-American pictures persuaded Sunqua to bring his light in from the left!" .
