Dick and Arrama Highly characteristic is Arrama's manner of holding a spear thrower in his hand. Beside being typically male attributes, spear throwers (na-warndag) also function as points of concentration and as supports for keeping balance during the swift trembling movements, which the dancers carry out with slightly bent legs, and knees apart. During these movements, the spear throwers are held upright, one end touching the ground. See especially also 6:1,3." .
