Serrurier aan de hr. von Luschan¹ te Berlijn betreft bogen van de Nieuwe Hebriden.\r\n\r\n\r\n¹  Felix Ritter von Luschan (11 August 1854 - 7 February 1924) was an Austrian doctor, anthropologist, explorer, archaeologist and ethnographer. (..) Luschan was born the son of a lawyer in Hollabrunn, Lower Austria, and attended the Akademisches Gymnasium in Vienna. After leaving school he studied medicine at the University of Vienna and anthropology in Paris, with an emphasis on craniometry. After he gained his doctorate in 1878, he was an army doctor in Austro-Hungarian occupied Bosnia and, together with the British archaeologist Arthur Evans, travelled through Dalmatia, Montenegro and Albania. From 1880 he worked as a medical assistant at the Vienna General Hospital and a lecturer (Privatdozent) at the University of Vienna in 1882\r\nOn 1 January 1886 Luschan took up a position as an assistant to Director Adolf Bastian at the Königliches Museum für Völkerkunde in Berlin (the present-day Ethnological Museum), where upon Bastian's death in 1905 he became Director of the Africa and Oceania Department. In this capacity he acquired one of the most important collections of Benin antiquities, ivory carvings, and bronze figures, details of which he published in his multivolume magnum opus. He also lead a huge collection campaign of the bones and skulls of thousands of people from across European empires. In 1906, this included human remains from the Herero-Nama Genocide" .
