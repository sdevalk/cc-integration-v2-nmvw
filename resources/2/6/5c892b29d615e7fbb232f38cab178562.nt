<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7265-1> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Pepper is a semi-humanoid robot developed by the media and telecommunication multinational Softbank (Japan) and Aldebaran Robotics (France), now Softbank Robotics. A friendly appearance, Pepper is intended for interaction with people, for instance with customers at stores. This robot - prototype released in 2014 - does not feature Artificial Intelligence, but relies on programming by humans. However, various preprogramming allows Pepper to recognize emotions of interaction partners. Interaction is carried out via voice commands and touch screen on Pepper’s chest. The sense of ‘real’ communication hinges on a pair of charming eyes that keep contact with the eyes of the dialogue partner by following that person’s location through cameras, microphones, and sensors. \r\nAs a semi-humanoid robot intended for connecting to humans on an emotional level, Pepper is not only employed at customer service desks, but also relied on in care homes, for instance. Furthermore, Pepper is part of multiple university studies into human-robot interaction. Museum Volkenkunde was the first museum in The Netherlands to display Pepper and allow visitors to interact with a robot, and touch it. According to futurologists robots will increasingly form part of society and daily interactions with robots will have become common already around the year 2050.\r\nThough limited in movement within spaces (rolling speed is max 3kph), head movement and hand gestures are relatively natural and lifelike, due to full articulation. This mechanical aspect of the robot relates to the Edo period automatons, karakuri ningyō からくり人形, of the 1820s in the Japanese collections of the National Museum of Worldcultures. These automatons - the principle was actually an import from Europe - are usually regarded as forebears of modern-day robotics." .
