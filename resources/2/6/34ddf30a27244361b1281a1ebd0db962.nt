In regular intervals, groups of four dog teeth are inserted into the ribbon. It is worn tightly around the neck. \r\nThe necklace is worn by women and men, often in combination with other ornaments. \r\nIt is mostly worn at ceremonial occasions, but can also be part of trading or a bride price, as the dog teeth had a high value due to their scarcity. The glass beads were introduced by European traders and often replaced traditional shell or coconut beads." .
