It tells the story of Nezha 哪吒 (the third lotus prince) before he became a deity in Chinese folk religion. Nezha was born after a long pregnancy of 3.5 years, and acquired the abilities of talking and walking right after birth. This genius child followed the immortal Taiyi Zhenren 太乙真人 as a student. At that time, the people were suffering from storms and drought because of the Dragon King of the Four Seas, who kept demanding human sacrifice. Nezha injured a subordinate of the Dragon King, and killed his son. The Dragon King became furious and caused more destructive disasters to the people. Nezha committed suicide to apologize and returned his flesh and bones to his parents, whom were infected by the anger of the Dragon King. His master helped him with his rebirth, rebuilding his body from a lotus blossom, and improving his weapons and abilities. Finally, Nezha defeated the Dragon King, claimed triumphant and offered peace and good climate to people.
