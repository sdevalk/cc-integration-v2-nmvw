Kooijman :\r\nOndiepe, ovale houten bak met lage en smalle rand. Aan de onderzijde met en relief figuur - voorstelling van een kikker (interpretatie Ds. F.C. Kamma). Volgens Ds Kamma is deze kikker het totemdier van de clan Oenge van Ase aan het Sentanimeer.\r\nHet voorwerp werd ter plaatse verzameld door de heer C.M.A Groenevelt en door deze gegeven aan Pouwer.\r\n\r\nFlat wooden dishes for serving sago, fish and meat \r\nare typical of Lake Sentani handicrafts and art. These dishes are usually oval, occasionally round, and a few have the shape of a halved ellipse. On one side there is knoblike extension, often with a hole to pass a loop through to hang up the dish. \r\nThey were household articles that were used daily by the women and remained in their possessions. Big ones (three or five feet long) were also made. These were owned by the ondoforo (chief) and were used to serve pork, the festive food for ceremonial occasion. \r\nA great number of these dishes have the entire outer surface ornamented with  incised patterns. Those of another group are decorated with a simple figure dominating the surface. Four animal motifs were predominant and were interpreted by local people as a turtle, a Papuan hornbill, a lizard, and a frog. In each case the body was represented by a diamond-shaped or ellipsoidal figure filled with spiral ornaments. What made a figure specific to the individual species was the way in which the legs or wings are added. These animals probably represented the clan ancestor." .
