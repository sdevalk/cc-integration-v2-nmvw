(back/front); ca. 1880.\r\n\tThe oldest known Mohave sandals were braided and stitched from willow bark, to be replaced by sandals made from badger skin, and later by horsehide. The soles were usually larger than the sole of the foot, and heel and toe straps of willow, leather of cloth were added. The thick soles of rawhide sandals were often trapezoidal in shape, with an incline towards the left and right (Spier 1933:97, plate VIV; 1955:7; cf. Gifford 1933:276). The Leiden pair is probably made from antelope or deer rawhide. The ties are made from cotton cloth which appears to be stained white, and reinforced with red cotton cloth. In addition there are two short leather ties at the back of the sole.\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)" .
