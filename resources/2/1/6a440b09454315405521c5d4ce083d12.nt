Versierd met zijden borduurwerk van meanderpatroon, vleermuizen en het Chinese karakter 'su', lang leven. De vleermuis en het karakter voor geluk zijn homofone gelukssymbolen in het Chinees. \"Pok\" betekent \"geluk\".\r\n\r\nThis is one of embroidered pads attached to each sides of a pillow for decoration. They were used for setting the shape of pillow or decorating it. People made a sack, filled it with dried herbs, and then embroidered it on both sides (maguri), which was very elaborate.\r\nThe names of pillows were put by those materials and patterns, which were named suchim for an embroidered pillow, najonchim for a nacreous pillow, sang'achim for an ivory pillow, tochim for an an earthen pillow etc.by their material. And there were wonangchim, embroidered a pair of lovebirds, gubongjim, embroidered nine phoenixes, subokchim, embroidered Chinese characters which meant long life and happiness, ssangyongchim, embroidered a couple of dragons, shipchangsaengchim, embroidered ten mythical animals such as turtle,dragon, and so on by their patterns.\r\nThe pillow with embroidery maguri was generally used, not only by the royal house but also by the commons people. The royal house and the upper class house preferred a nacreous pillow, najonjim, especially, made in tong'yong, which were famous for their beautiful and brilliant colours. \r\nThe forms of the pillow were square or round it seems to be divided for men, women, or for children by their size. It seems that the reason why people decorated the pillow was that they had good dreams while sleeping on the pillows.\r\nThis begaemaguri has a chinese character 'su' in the middle and symmetrical patterns of bats. Abstract patterns using a chinese character 'bok' around the end of the circle support the theme. Subok means long life and happiness and bats are symbols of fertility. All patterns are embroidered." .
