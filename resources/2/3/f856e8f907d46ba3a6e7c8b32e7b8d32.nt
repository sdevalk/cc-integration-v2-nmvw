The vessel has an orange-yellow slip. Its origin remains in doubt, and suggestions include that it is a prehistoric specimen, a traditional early 1880s Walpi bowl, or a 1880s souvenir made for the tourist trade. Ten Kate kept this bowl in his private collection until 1921 because he probably found it aesthetically pleasing.\r\n674-32; 2012-16 Hopi pottery\r\n\tLike basketry weaving, pottery making is an ancient art and craft, practiced by the prehistoric Anasazi ancestors of the Hopis. Pottery is made by the women. Early summer and the time after the harvest are the preferred seasons for pottery making, and calm windless days are perfect for firing. Clay for the vessels is dug from seams in the sandstone, and sand is added as temper. Different sorts of clay are preferred for different types of vessels, cooking ware requiring different specifications from other wares. Vessels are built up from coils of clay that are flattened both inside, first with the fingers, then by using a dried gourd rind. With a sanding stone the dried outer surface is smoothly polished, after which a white kaolin slip (k√ºchachka) is applied with a rabbit fur cloth and again polished when dry. Decoration is applied with yucca splints, often splayed at the end into brushes. Pigments from yellow ochre turn red during firing; ironstone, mixed with seeds of the tansy mustard, turns dark brown to black. Dried corn cobs and dried sheep dung are the preferred fuels for the firing. Sometimes bones of deer, cattle or sheep are added to the fire pile, as their burning is believed to impart an extra whiteness to the white slipped surface. Bones of horses and mules are not used for this purpose, as they have a darkening effect. Sacred cornmeal is spread on the fire. If the wind picks up during the firing process, a windbreak is hastily made, piling up a bank op sand and stone. A firing lasts between two and four hours (Colton 1931:5-4).\r\n\tHopi women used to copy designs encountered on prehistoric wares which they saw on shards picked up from the surface. Alexander M. Stephen noted that potters did not remember the meaning of most designs they painted on their vessels.\r\n\tIn Ten Kate's time, First Mesa was the center of pottery production, and the women of Walpi were by far the best potters. At Sichomovi there were also potters active and some Tewa women at Hano also made pottery, but were less adapt at the art and craft, excepting Nampeyo who had been taught at Walpi and would become an innovator in the 1890s (Stephen 1939:35,130,482-3,1020-2,1187-1190; Allen 1984:21-23).\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)" .
