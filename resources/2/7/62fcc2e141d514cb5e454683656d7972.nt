<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7181-1> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Tejaâ€™s work is inspired by the characters in Hindu epics such as Ramayana, since as a child he loved watching perfomances of wayang kulit theatre, but his narratives reflect on the modern world in Bali, such as the impact of tourism. He is mostly attracted to very strong, fierce full  characters, who in his paintings show that they also have a very soft side to them. He also likes animals, and often paints fables from the Tantri Kamandaka. \r\nWanita raksasa, female demon, is a very strong painting. According to Teja Astawa the painting depicts a female demon, who is in search of love, carrying her doll with her.\r\nThe little figures are soldiers who are frightened of the big demonic figure. However, she is harmless, she is only looking for love. It is like ants, who bite us because they are frightened of our big bodies, whereas we are only for example sweeping the floor." .
