The handle is made as part of the bag itself. The base of this bag is straight and unshaped. The bag is decorated by alternating bands of red-coloured and naturally coloured string. A note attached to the specimen reads ' \"Wurra wurra\" made from cord of Hibiscus bark'. In a letter to the museum dated October 1892 Miss Bundock says of this artefact, 'One bag made of bark fibre string. The bark is that of an Hibiscus and the bag is called \"wurra wurra\" '.\r\n\r\nBags: Bags and baskets illustrate the Aboriginal women's handicrafts which were so admired by the early settlers and explorers. Most of the historical sources mention the two types of bag represented in the collections, the coiled bag of grass which they refer to as 'woven' and the netted bag of bark fibre cord. They were made by the women and used to carry their personal equipment and valuables (Fanning 1913; Flick 1934; Dawson 1935:10). The men apparently also used small bags made of the dilly-bag grass to carry little items; these they wore on the left shoulder, tucked under the armpit (Bundock 1898:2). The bags were made with considerable skill: 'The gins were expert at making netbags from stinging tree bark. They also made a finer woven bag from rushes to be found in the swamps. Many of these bags were well made and of artistic design' (Flick 1934). Miss Bundock mentions both a grass-like plant and a rush used for the coiled bags; she identifies them as Xerotes multiflora and Gladium glomeratium (letter to Dr. Serrurier dated November 1885 - (see Appendix 2). Apparently there was no distinction in function between the two types of bag. However the bag made of rushes was called 'Buchee ban', the other 'Dilli ban'.\r\n\r\nThe bark fibre used for the net bags was obtained from the Hibiscus tree according to the records of Miss Bundock, from the stinging tree according to those of Flick. The Hibiscus tree is probably either Hibiscus tiliaceus (a small tree found in northern New South Wales, especially near the coast) or Hibiscus heterophyllus, often called the 'Green Kurrajong' (Anderson 1968:231; Maiden 1889:624).\r\n\r\nThe techniques used in making these bags include coiling (for those made of grass or reeds) and both knotless (loop and twist) and knotted netting for those made of bark fibre cord. The coiling technique for making flat bags and baskets seems to be confined to eastern Australia (see Davidson 1933:277). The netting techniques, especially those using knots are much more widespread (ibid:258, 260). The knotless netting has a more easterly distribution pattern, especially the loop and twist variety which is represented in the dilly bags in the Leiden collection.\r\n\r\nNo. 4:\r\nA string bag made by the native women from the bark of the hibiscus which grows along the river banks and on the edge of the dense jungle with which our mountains are covered.\r\nThe women strip the bark off the shrubs and soak it in water then chew it to seperate the vegetable matter from the fibre, which they then twist with the hand holding the other end in their toes. The string is colored with a red ochreous earth.\r\n\r\nHet koord is gedraaid van de bastvezel van een tot het hibiscus-geslacht behorende boom [Bron: beschrijvingskaart]" .
