<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7158-372> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This is a visualisation of an episode from the DeviMahatmya (Great Goddess) oral and textual tradition. Here, the goddess is fighting a demon who can take on any shape that they like. The demon cannot be defeated if he changes form. However, the goddess manages to slay him when he is transitioning from demon into Buffalo. The slaying of a buffalo during Navratri (A nine night Hindu festival in Spring and in Autumn) is often part of rituals in Indian and other South Asian religious contexts, to mark this battle. \r\nThis visualisation is a popular print, that can be used in people's homes to worship but also in temples." .
