<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/TM-4400-2> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This map was printed by the Amsterdam based publishers Covens & Mortier ca. 1730-1745. It is based on the original map by Guillaume Delisle made in 1708. The map depicts Africa south of the equator from a European perspective. \r\n\r\nDelisle based his maps not only on existing European maps of Africa, but also on accounts from European travellers such as merchants, sailors, and missionaries who had visited the region. As a result, the map contains a great deal of detail and names many different groups in kingdoms in the interior of Africa, including some indigenous names, at least compared to earlier maps. \r\n\r\nThis map contains one of the first relatively accurate depictions of the lake now known as Lake Victoria. Maps had depicted great lakes in this region since antiquity, but unlike previous maps, this map does not show the lake as connected to any of the great African river systems such as the Nile.\r\n\r\nDespite this attention to detail, the map still represents a European view on Africa. By this time, Europeans had established numerous trading posts on the coastline of the African continent, and European fleets were regularly passing by to trade with Africans, or to capture enslaved people, or on their way to Asia. There is a great deal of detail on the coastal regions. This includes Dutch settlements such as the Cape of Good Hope (‘Fort Hollandois’ or Cape Town) , Portuguese outposts such as Sena and Tete along the Zambezi river, and Zanzibar, which had come under the control of Oman only a few years earlier.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Europeans had not yet begun large-scale colonization of the interior of Africa, and as a result, the depiction of the interior of the continent, though better than previous maps, is still sparse in detail and quite inaccurate. The interior of the continent is neatly divided into European style kingdoms, presenting a fictional account of political organization in Africa. Maps depicting Africa as an empty continent started to appear at the end of the 18th century, marking the prelude to the large-scale colonization of the African continent by European powers." .
