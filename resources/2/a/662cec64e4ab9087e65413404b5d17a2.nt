<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1181-29> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The bowl is hewn from one piece of palm wood. The diameter is oval and the bowl has four cylindrical feet. The surface is polished with a checkering file and a pumice. It was coloured dark brown after. The bowl has two separately carved handles, which are cut out from the wood together with the bowl. The handles probably served as decoration and not as actual handles to lift the bowl. \r\nThe outer side often has carved decorations, mostly a band around the upper rim which shows geometrical patterns. The handles show reptiles or lizards lying on their back and holding on to two sticks, which are attached to the rim of the bowl. \r\nThe carving of the bowls was the job of men.\r\nThe bowl was used as a dish for food, most likely soup. It was reserved for persons of high rank. \r\nA second function of wooden bowls was during ceremonies and rituals. \r\nIn healing ceremonies, a wooden bowl with water was part of the equipment of the healer. The water was stirred to take in the soul, so that it could later be placed back into the ill person. \r\nA large wooden bowl was also reported to have been part of a feast to remember a deceased leader. The new leader was the host of this feast. All guests put as many betel nuts in the bowl as they had brought pigs to honour the new leader. When everybody had his turn, all the nuts were counted aloud in front of everybody. \r\nSometimes, skulls of deceased family members were kept in such a bowl in the house to entertain a good  relationship to the patron ghost of the house, which the soul of the deceased is considered to be. The soul of a deceased father has the most protective powers. The skull protects the house and its people from malicious influences. It also punishes the family member, who act sinfully or against the moral. Offerings like aromatic herbs are put in the bowl from time to time. On public feasts, the bowl with the skull is brought out to the veranda and all the offerings made by the house owner are made in the name of the ghost." .
