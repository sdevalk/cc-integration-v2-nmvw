Sometimes they had painted geometric designs, symbolizing the prey. This specimen is undecorated.\r\nTen Kate participated in the 1888 Zuni hunt and provided a good description. Although the Indians used their traditional hunting sticks, he called these \"javelins\" in his narrative: \"… took part in one of the big chase-hunts near Ojo Caliente, which are held every year after the gathering of the crops as a way of thanksgiving. This kind of hunt only takes place in the … agricultural districts … Hundreds of Indians on horseback, dressed festively and armed with javelins, took part in it. … at the hunting-field … the great father of the Kôk'kô or Holy Dance organisation, A'wan tatchu Ko'yemshi, with his assistant and a priest of the Huntingorder (San'iakiakwe) performed a simple but impressive ceremony that was attended in good earnest by everybody present. The great father said the prayers, while his assistant and the Hunting priest joined him every time with the word athlu (so be it). After that the great father and his assistant breathed on each other, after which the latter repeated the prayer of the father; they held hands when they did this. In this prayer, besides thanking for the crops of this year, they pray for a rich crop next season, for the well-being of the A'shiwi in general and for a joyful awakening in the Ko'thluwala'wa (residence of the Council of the Gods). Then all went to a little cedar tree, that had been set afire previously. Here the three again said prayers, this time for the dead, throwing héwé (wafer bread) into the fire as offerings. … The hunters came to the great father in small groups, who gave them some héwé to offer into the fire. Finally the hunters quickly run there javelins through the flames, praying for good luck on their hunt, that could start only now. As I heard from Cushing, this prayer partly exists of archaic words.\"\r\n\t\"This kind of reckless and rash driving was new to me. The small, unsightly looking Indian horses, one of which I was riding, showed here what they were able to. The wild passion of the riders seemed to be shared by the horses. Divided in numerous small groups the men hunted the mainly flat, but rather woody plain at full gallop. Although this hunt was supposed to be a rabbit hunt, many hares, and even a prairie wolf as well, fell under the javelins which the Indians wielded dexterously. The motley flying troupe of riders, the dull droning of thousands of hoofs, the fearful game, the fierce sun, all constituted an unforgettable scene. Towards evening the riders and horses returned to Zuni covered with dust and sweat. Hundreds of rabbits and hares hung on the horses in bunches.\"\r\n\t\"The riders who bring booty have to perform another ceremony when they get home. The animal is carefully put on a blanket, with a corncob between their front paws and the head pointing towards the east. Every member of the family sprinkles some flour and prays for the ghosts of the dead game to return to their residence to send more rabbits and hares to the Zuni. Then the game is skinned and roasted according to fixed rules. Only then it may be eaten\" (Ten Kate 1925:139-141; Hovens 1995:693-695).\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)" .
