The mana-malham'nj bunches not yet fastened, but the men hold these provisionally before their legs.'lining up' has ceremonial functions and will be performed later on this afternoon, just before sunset, but without the bunches, on the dancing ground in front of predominantly female spectators. This ceremony, a spectacular show-piece, gives the dancers an opportunis· to make their bow, so to say, to a female public not allowed to attend the main events of the forthcoming night. It symbolises the contrast between the first night's (female) and second night's (male) performances. This is aso ritualiy expressed by the act of a woman (sometimes two of them) who appears on the scene and passes along both sides of the line of men, wiping their legs with a rope. Cf. recording filed tape 29/2." .
