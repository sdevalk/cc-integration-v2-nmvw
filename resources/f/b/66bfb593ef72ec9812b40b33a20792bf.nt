This ceremony involves the placing of the deceased’s bones into a hollow log which was decorated with painted clan designs and ceremonially placed into the ground where it remained until it slowly decayed over many years.\r\n\r\nThe log is made from a termite hollowed Stringybark tree (Eucalyptus tetradonta) and is decorated with totemic emblems.\r\n\r\nThe western Arnhem Land version of the lorrkkon ceremony involves the singing of sacred songs to the accompaniment of karlikarli, a pair of sacred boomerangs used as rhythm instruments.\r\n\r\nDuring the final evening of the ceremony, dancers decorate themselves with kapok down, or today, cotton wool and conduct much of the final segments of the ceremony in the secrecy of arestricted mens’ camp. The complete ceremony may stretch over a period of two weeks. On the last night the bones of the deceased which have been kept in a bark container or today wrapped in cloth and kept in a suitcase are taken out, painted with red ochre and placed inside the hollow log. This ceremony may take place many years after the person has died.\r\n\r\nAt first light on the final morning of the lorrkkon ceremony, the men appear, coming out of their secret bush camp carrying the pole towards the women’s camp. The two groups call to each other using distinct ceremonial calls. The woman have prepared a hole for the pole to be placed into and when it is stood upright, woman in particular kinship groups to the deceased dance around the pole in a jumping/shuffling motion. The lorrkkon is then often covered with a tarpaulin and telft to slowly decay.\r\n\r\nThis specific lorrkkon is made from hollow log and swordfish" .
