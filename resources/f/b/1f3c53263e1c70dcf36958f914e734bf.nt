<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/573a423940fea9f34bada6e0bee9c189> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Dit borstsieraad werd vroeger gedragen door de Hawaiiaanse adel en met name de \"ali'i\", de hoofdman, als symbool van macht en status. Deze halssieraden werden ontwikkeld aan het einde van de negentiende eeuw toen walvisvaarders en handelaren potvis- en walrustanden in overvloed konden leveren waardoor de ambachtslieden de mogelijkheid hadden om grote en kostbaardere versies te maken van de oudere sieraden die van hout, steen of menselijk been waren gemaakt. Ook de strengen menselijk haar werden fijner gevlochten. In diezelfde periode nam de macht van inheemse adel af en begonnen meer mensen dit van oorsprong statussymbool te dragen. Deze sieraden werden aan het eind van de negentiende eeuw in veel gemaakt voor de handel omdat zij een typisch Hawaiiaans handelsproduct waren.\r\n\r\nLei niho palaoa were worn by the Hawaiian ali‘i (member of the chiefly classes) as status symbols during important ceremonial occasions, but also in battle. Until the 19th century, when whaling moved from the Arctic to the tropical seas of the Pacific, Hawaiians would not hunt for whales. However, all parts of the beached mammals were considered property of the chief.  Honolulu on O‘ahu and Lahaina on Maui became important whaling ports where ships hunting in the Japan Sea, the South Pacific and later again the Arctic stopped to replenish stocks and change crews. The transiting of whale oil for lamps, heating and lubrication for industrial machinery and baleen strips for use in corsets, skirt hoops, umbrellas and buggy whips transformed these Hawaiian ports into international hubs starting in 1819. The local whaling economy surged especially after 1830 when the sandalwood trade to China was completely replaced by an economy centred around pork and yam provisions for the whalers.  \r\n\r\nDespite the wide availability of whale bone because of the whaling industry, the Aotearoa-New Zealand researcher Te Rangi Hiroa documents walrus ivory being used to make hangers for the lei niho palaoa.  He also demonstrated that most of the hooks were made in post-contact times. Between 1790 and 1810 a large amount of walrus ivory reached Hawai‘i – the place to take in provisions – as a side product of the transpacific fur trade between the American Northwest Coast and China.  While no testing has been done on the NMvW necklaces, close physical examination suggests that the hooks were indeed made of whale ivory. \r\n\r\nHistoric sources document that the hair used came from the women of the attendants of the chief. To that purpose they would let the hair grow for six to seven years, period by which it would have reached the ankles. The donation of hair coming from the head, the most sacred or tapu part of the body, was considered the utmost sign of devotion.  The archaeologist Patrick Vinton Kirch suggests that the style of the ornament is derived from shapes found in the Hawaiian archipelago from the end of the first millennium onwards. He thinks that the use of whale ivory was a later development becoming prevalent when whaling vessels started stopping in Hawai‘i to replenish their supplies.  \r\n\r\nThere is debate about to what the shape of the carved whale ivory refers. A popular interpretation has been that it refers to the tongue of a god, but the British dermatologist and microbiologist who collected in Hawai‘i, Eduard Arnings (1855-1936) surmised it might even represent the tongue of an enemy.  The anthropologist Adrienne Kaeppler suggested that the evolution of the shape of the lei niho palaoa may have been an artistic interpretation of the naturally curved whale’s tooth.  Moreover, it mimics the outline of feathered crest-shaped helmets (mahiole), which, when worn together with the necklace, frame the head, containing the mana, the power and essence of the ali‘i. Hence, the art historian Stacey Kamehiro offers the more recent interpretation of seeing the whale ivory curve as a vessel for mana.  The symbolic meaning is enhanced by the materials used: human hair coming from the most sacred part of the body is associated with whale’s tooth, a relatively rare and sacred material from the sea, make this ornament particularly suitable for gods and chiefs." .
