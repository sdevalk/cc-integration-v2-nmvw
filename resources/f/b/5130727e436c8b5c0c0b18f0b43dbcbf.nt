<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-674-59> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "674-59\r\nPapago gaming sticks; wood, pigments; av. l. 18.3 cm., w. 1.2 cm., th. 0.6 cm.; ca. 1880.\r\n\tTen Kate noted that this set of four gaming sticks was used for the quince (Sp.: fifteen) game, played by women. He records the native name for the game as pahahi or pakaki. Underhill (1939:144-145) records the Papago name for the game as kinyskut, a derivation of the Spanish name, but states that the game was played by men, never by women and children. The slightly rounded backs of the sticks are painted black, the flat fronts have been stained red, but lack incised and painted designs, indicating their numerical value. Because of its good material condition, this set was probably still unfinished when Ten Kate purchased it. Quince was played by many Indian tribes in the Greater Southwest, including the Pimas and Tarahumaras (cf. Culin 1907:148; Russell 1908:175-176; Fontana 1979:67; RMV 362-76 in the Yuman chapter).\r\n(Hovens 2009)\r\n\r\nQuince spel voor vrouwen.\r\n\"This game is still known, but probably not played, by some of the older women.\" (Mrs. W. Kaemlein, Arizona State Museum, 15 oktober 1964)." .
