Although stylistic differences exist between art made by these different groups, their artworks more closely resemble each other than they do the groups farther to the south, such as the Nuxalk, Nuu-chah-nulth, and Kwak’waka’wakw, the Central Northwest Coast groups.  \r\n\t\r\nBecause the sculpture of the northern groups is so similar, this Janus-faced rattle has been variously identified as of Haida, Tlingit and Tsimshian origin. Unfortunately, since the actual location at which this artwork was purchased has not been recorded, we must guess as to its provenance. There are some features that connect it to the Tsimshian artistic tradition, such as the skin pulled tightly over sharp cheekbones, tight thin lips and a sharply ridged nose.\r\n\t\r\nAlthough one cannot identify its original owners with complete confidence, it is evident what it depicts. On one side is a male face, on the other a female identified by a circular plug inserted into her lower lips. Among the northern Northwest Coast people, girls at the age of puberty had a thin pin inserted into their lower lips. At marriage, they received a larger labret; the most aristocratic adult women in these groups would have large plate-like plugs that declared their high status. When Europeans and Americans first encountered these labret wearers at the end of the 18th century, they commented with disgust on this tradition, not understanding their function as indicators of womanhood and rank.\r\n\t\r\nThe other certainty we have about this piece is that a shaman used it during his rituals of healing. The shaman was an individualist who could enter trance states at will and ecstatically summon up his powers and spirit helpers. These states have been described as out of body experiences, or sensations of flying, floating, or twirling in a whirlpool. Their chief function was to cure the sick. \r\n\t\r\nThe Tsimshian shaman was selected by spirits who indicated their choice by appearing to him or her in visions or dreams.  Novices experienced serious illness from which they were healed only when they accepted the role as shaman and thus demonstrated that they had the power to cure themselves. Associated with the shamans were a variety of spirit beings that served as assistants and appeared on various items of regalia during ceremonies.\r\n\t\r\nRattles were essential parts of the shaman’s equipment. Franz Boas published an account of a Tsimshian shamanic séance in which a sick person summons a male shaman. This man and his 10-18 “shaman friends” enter the house with a bag full of their regalia.  He removes his rattle, attaches his dance apron and dons a crown of bear claws and a necklace of bear tooth charms. Then the shaman: “… takes his rattle in his right hand….. He calls upon his spirit helpers, saying ‘Save him, save him!’ and his companions repeat what he has said.  … He works around the patient, shaking his rattle…. His eyes are closed, and his left hand is raised, which the palm towards the patient. A female shaman is seated at the foot of the patient…[and] has a rattle in her right hand, which she shakes lightly” (Boas 1916:333). Like other percussive instruments such as drums, the repetitious rhythmic shaking of rattles contributes to the shaman’s achievement of an altered state of consciousness so central to his or her practice.\r\n\t\r\nGlobular rattles often have different images on each side. But why should this particular example depicts both male and female spirits?  It is not uncommon for shamans around the world to draw power from both male and female spirits or assume characteristics of both genders as yet another indication of their other-worldliness. The appearance of both sexes on this rattle may allude to the shaman’s ability to transcend the division between male and female, just as he transcends the difference between animals and humans, life and death, and this world and the other world.\r\n\r\nAldona Jonaitis\r\nUniversity of Alaska Museum, Fairbanks, AK; 2015\r\n\r\nFranz Boas, Tsimshian Mythology; Thirty-First Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology; Washington, D.C., 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nDe Indianenstammen aan de Noordwestkust van Amerika leefden, in tegenstelling tot die van de rest van Amerika, voornamelijk van de visvangst. Dankzij een grondige kennis van de gewoonten van met name de zalm, waren zij in staat de visvangst tot een bijzonder lucratieve bestaanswijze te maken. Zo ontstond dankzij deze relatieve rijkdom een bovenlaag die er zelfs slaven op na wist te houden. Regelmatig werden zogenaamde potlatches georganiseerd en overigens werden vele gelegenheden tot feestvieren aangegrepen. Deze levenswijze bracht een grote variëteit aan dansattributen met zich mee, waaronder vooral de zogenoemde dansratels een bijzondere plaats innemen. Vaak bestaan deze uit twee min of meer gelijke helften, hol, waarbinnen stenen, zaden, en dergelijke rammelen. Beide helften zijn in dit geval met een menselijk gezicht gedecoreerd. Opvallend is overigens dat dit stuk, in tegenstelling tot het merendeel van de dansratels, geen enkel spoor van beschildering vertoont. Over de mogelijke dualiteit die in de twee gezichten is weergegeven, valt niets met zekerheid te zeggen.\r\n\r\nEngelse tekst:\r\nThe Indian tribes of the northwest coast of the American continent, unlike those inhabiting the rest of North America, lived mainly from fishing. They understood the behaviour of the salmon so well that fishing was extremely lucrative. This relative wealth gave rise to an upper class who were even rich enough to keep slaves. Potlatches were organized frequently and festivities were held whenever an excuse to do so could be found. This life style was accompanied by the genesis of a wide variety of dance attributes among which a special place was taken by rattles. The rattles were usually composed of two more or less identical hollow parts into which pebbles, seeds, and the like were inserted to produce the sound. Both parts of the rattle shown here are decorated with a human face, but in contrast with the great majority of Indian rattles there are no traces of a painted decoration. Nothing can be said with certainty about the possibility that some kind of duality is expressed in the two faces." .
