<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-362-48> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "362-48\r\nPima braided horse halter; saachki (TK), sha:kim (Saxton et.al. 1983); horsehair, cloth; l. 38 cm.; ca. 1880.\r\nThe Spanish introduced horses to the Pimas in the seventeenth century. The Indians soon learned how to ride them, but the supply of animals was lagging far behind demand until the last quarter of the nineteenth century. The mounts also had difficulty finding sufficient fodder in the desert, and lived on saltbush in wintertime. In the spring the sprouting mesquite provided nourishment, followed a little later by mesquite beans. Summer rains nurtured a variety of grasses. In times of famine, horses were eaten. Horsehair was used for making rope, tumplines, cinches, and hair extensions, the latter a practice of the men. Different colors of horsehair were used for aesthetic effect (Russell 1908:28,81,84-85,106,113,115,143,158).\r\nThis horse halter consists of a two-strand loop of braided black and white horsehair, and is partially reinforced with a netted cover in the center and two wrappings at the sides. The loop is held together by a netted knob, and the ends of the horsehair are left loose. A Pima informant of Hovens stated that such halters were also specifically used to whip people suspected of witchcraft, and drive the evil out of them.\r\n(Hovens 2009)\r\n\r\nHalster van wit en zwart paardenhaar gevlochten." .
