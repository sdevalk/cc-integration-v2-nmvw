There are different parts of the apron. The upper part is a plaited plant fibre belt, which has strings attached to tie it around the hip. On this there are some adornments in form of strings of shell discs and nut shells. \r\nThe biggest part is made of several width of cord with shell discs (shell money), in which dark beads are plaited to make a pattern. The bottom parts are loose cords which again have nut shells and feathers tied to them for decoration.\r\nThe shell discs are also called shell money, because large amounts of them on strings were used for trading, ceremonial exchange or were part of a woman's wedding attire. The large amount used for the apron are an indicator that it was valuable and therefore mostly worn by high-positioned women.\r\nTheir value came from their difficult manufacturing process, which was a woman's job. The small shells have to be drilled to make a hole in the centre. Then the top is cut off and the discs are polished. (Ohnemus in Kaufmann 2002, p. 54) \r\nThe apron was worn specifically at dancing ceremonies or at wedding ceremonials when it served as wedding attire. They were not used for everyday-purposes. (Ohnemus 1996, p. 105)" .
