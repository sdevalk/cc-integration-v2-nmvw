The lower part, probably a bundle of feathers, is missing. The top is designed as a stylised head with big earlobes, which has attached a hollowed-out wooden frame for the feathers. \r\nIt was tightly tied to the back of the neck with a cord, in such a way that the carved face looked upwards and the feathers stuck out. \r\nIt was only worn by men as war ornamentation and had a protective function for the neck as well as serving as a lucky charm. Often the heads represented famous mythical warriors or ancestors." .
