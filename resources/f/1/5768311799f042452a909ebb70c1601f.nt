There is a big river at Makarrki where we catch a lot of turtle and dugong.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBENTINCK ISLAND\r\nBentinck Island was initially discovered by Jan Carstenz in 1623 and was also one of the first parts of the Gulf of Carpentaria surveyed in detail by the explorer Matthew Flinders in 1802. After Flinders' brief encounter the Kaiadilt remained isolated for the next 145 years. There had also been intermittent documented contact with Bentinck Islanders from 1901, and 1925 Presbyterian Missionaries made systematic efforts to relocate them to Mornington Island.\r\n\r\nIn the 1940s severe drought affected communities in the Gulf. This culminated in the deterioratio9n of Kaiadilt homelands and the eventual transportation of the population to Mornington Island by the missionaries. In the 1980's the Kaladilt people began to re-establish themselves on Bentinck Island. However, the Mornington Island Island community of Gununa is still major resource centre for these people today." .
