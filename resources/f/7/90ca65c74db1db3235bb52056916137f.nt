Their relatives in southwestern Louisiana also take part in the tourist industry.\r\nOne type is souvenirs consists of animal effigies, made from pinecones to which other plant materials are added. Basketry is still being made, round coiled baskets ad well as square and rectangular plaited ones. With strips of fiber, bark and wood dyed with natural and commercial agents, geometric patterns are applied to plaited surfaces. Often split swamp cane stems (Arundinaria) and splints of white oak (Quercus alba) are used for plaiting. Sedge grass is used for sewing coils." .
