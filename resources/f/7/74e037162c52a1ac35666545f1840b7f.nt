<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7106-502> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "PUKUMANI, burial poles from the Tiwi lslands.\r\n\r\nAboriginal people use the expression \"sorry business\" for everything associated with the death of a person. Aborigines regard death as a stage in a never ending spiral of life, death and rebirth. On the Tiwi lslands Bathurst and Melville (North-Australia), this concept is applied in the Pukumani ceremony. Pukamani dictates a particuliar style of behaviour for the individuals connected with the deceased person. lt stipulates taboos about touching certain people, food and objects. The ceremonies  can take months. Lonely and unsettled, the spirit of the deceased looks for his family. He can be dangerous. lt is only after the final ceremonies have finished that the spirit finds peace with other relatives in the world of the spirits.\r\n\r\nDuring the ceremonies, the participants camouflage themselves with body-paintings and false beards to avoid recognition. In this way they hope to deceive the ghost who can hurt them.\r\nThe burial poles, which feature prominently in the ceremony, are often called Pukumani, but their real name is Tutini. The Tiwi people regard the burial poles as characteristic of the deceased. They are made out of recently felled iron trees or blood trees and are usually 2 to 3 meters tall. These sculptured and painted poles are among the most spectacular art of the Aborigines: The painted geometric patterns on the pole represent the personal totem of the deceased person. The painters make use of natural paints like yellow and red ochre, white clay and charcoal mixed with a binder. The process of creating and erecting the poles is an important part of the ceremony. While the artists are working, food is taken to them in baskets of bark. Also the payment tor their work and gifts are given to them in these baskets. The baskets are painted in the same motifs as the burial poles. When the ceremony has ended they are sometimes hung over the top of the poles. In earlier days, the baskets were used to store the possessions of the deceased until they were burned.\r\nThe more important a person was during his life, the more burial poles he gets. A person with a high esteem might end up with as many as 15 or 17 burial poles, whereas a child may only get one.\r\nThe relatives of the deceased order the Pukumani through the intermediary of a highly respected middle aged man, who then will negotiate with the artists who make the poles.\r\n\r\nTIWI ISLANDS HISTORY\r\nThe Dundas Strait separate Melville & Bathurst Island from mainland Australia. Melville Island is the second largest island after Tasmania, situated north of Darwin in the Northern Territory. Measuring 3200 square kilometres Melville has a population of approximately 800, Bathurst Island 1500 Tiwi people.\r\n\r\nThe country is mainly open Eucalypt forest with pockets of Monsoonal Vine forest. The beaches are long, white and sandy, interspersed with Mangrove swamps which provide the rich feeding grounds for marine life including crocodiles.\r\n\r\nMelville Island has fresh water in abundance with streams and water holes throughout the Island. The seasons are wet band dry. One hot, wet and humid, the other, dry and cool.\r\n\r\nHaving had such intimate contact with their country for thousands of years, the Tiwi people identify seasons which enabled them to determine ceremonial periods and to follow hunting sequences with precision. There are three major seasons that the Tiwi recognise and many minor seasons, some only as short as a week, based on environmental events that are characteristic of that time of year. With seven months of virtually no rain, immense storm clouds start building up: but for another two months they rarely unleash their power to relieve the intense humidity that they create, though there are often spectacular lightning displays. During this time the cicadas emerge and their shrill song can be heard across the land. This is Tyari (season of the song of the cicada).\r\nTumutakari (rainy season) begins around Christmas time when the storms finally break. In only months they produce up to 2,500 mm of rain, causing lush, tropical growth.\r\nAbout March/April the last of the storms hit with a powerful wind which flattens the tall grasses that have thrived during the wet season. When the vegetation dries it is deliberately lit, creating the period of Kumunupinari (season of smoke).  Each firing has a result- how long it will last, how far it will burn and what plants will regrow afterwards. This knowledge of fire and its effects is used as a cultural tool to improve the availability of major food and animals.\r\n\r\nThe first recorded contact with Tiwi and outsiders dates back to the Macassans in the 15th and 16th centuries. Malaysians and Indonesian visits have continued throughout the centuries. Plus Japanese pearlers.Records of Dutch explorers go back as early 1644, well before Captain Cook and the British invasion. The first permanent entry of outsiders into Tiwi islands dates back to 1895 apart from the British Military settlement at Fort Dundas from 1824 to 1829. With the establishment of the Missionaries at Bathurst Island, Tiwi people were moved to Nguiu. Once government settlements were established on Melville Island at Milikapiti and Pularumpi Tiwi began to move back to their country. Tiwi \"officially\" regained their land in 1976 with the Aboriginal Land Rights Northern Territory Act." .
