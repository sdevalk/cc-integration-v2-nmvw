<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/0edcccf0146fb62d4edf571a6dfd2eaf> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This lower jaw of a pig or boar, considering the tusks at the front, had a special ceremonial meaning. They were kept as a reminder of big feasts in houses and men's houses, where they were hung up at the roof beams. \r\nThe jaw was cleaned and the middle and front part were coated with a thick layer of Parinarium, so that the cannot be seen anymore. This coat was adorned with incised pattern and then coloured in.  The two sides of the back part have holes in them to be able to hang them up. \r\nPigs are found all over the Admiralty islands and are the most important of all domestic animals. Pork is the most highly valued meat and therefore the distribution of it at feasts is very important. The showing of many jaws as an indicator to the number of pigs received and eaten thus equals high status and prosperity." .
