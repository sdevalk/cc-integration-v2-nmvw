Under the system of racial segregation which was in place in South Africa for most of the 20th century, most public facilities including post offices were classified as being either for 'Whites/Europeans' or for 'non-Whites' only.  As this man would have been classified as 'non-White' he would only be allowed to use facilities designated as such. Facilities designated as 'Whites only' would have been off-limits to him. This designation would be indicated by a sign, such as the one seen in this photo. Signs like these were seen all over South Africa. The facilities designated for 'non-Whites' were generally vastly inferior to those provided for 'Whites only'. \r\n\r\nThe system of racial segregation already existing in South Africa in the early 20th century, was eventually developed into an extreme form of institutionalized racism known as apartheid. Under this system, South Africa's white minority population controlled most of the country's political and economic power. People designated as 'non-Whites' were deprived of basic human rights. Apartheid legislation was not abolished until 1991. South Africa became a multi-racial democracy in 1994." .
