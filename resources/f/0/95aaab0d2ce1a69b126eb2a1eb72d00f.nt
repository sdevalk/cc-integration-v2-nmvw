<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1999-628> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Outrigger canoe with two sails. These claw-shaped sails were highly functional. The tapering off of the sail toward the claw tips ensures that the sail area is supported by the marginal spars should decrease away from the point of attachment of those spars. This allows efficient operation with far lighter spars and mast, and in general much less weight and stress on the mast than any other inverted triangular shape would impose. It allows the spars not to break. This kind of sail appeared in Hawaii,  the Polynesian Outliers, Taumako, the Santa Cruz and probably in Pentecost Island (Vanuatu). Farther west still it was used on Motu lakatoi and Mailu orou. The Mailu and Motu are East-Austronesian speaking people of coastal, south-eastern Papua, who settled around the time of Christ. It is perhaps significant that this same region is one of the last strongholds of that other characteristic Eastern-Austronesian artefact, the double canoe. Its distribution would fit in with the known facts of Polynesian expansion, notably the dispersal west and east from the Samoan region during the first millennium BC." .
