<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-2385-23> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This ceremonial dance ornament represents a black stork. It is carved from wood with great precision and excellent craftmanship. The top is largely decorated with coix seeds and abrus pips. The head and the long beak is painted black and the neck is covered with black seeds. The eyes of the bird are also indicated by abrus pips. The parts without pips have been painted yellow. There are a few real feathers attached to the body, mainly on the sides and wings. On the bottom there is a hole to which a stick was attached by means of which the ornament was carried above the bearer's head. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t  According to the donor, children carried this object attached to a stick during the parade in honour of the marriage of Princess Juliana of the Netherlands. Since the stork is a very popular totemic ancestor/animal among Marind people, therefore it takes prominent place in festive parades. \t\t\t\t\t\t`\t\t\t\t The figure of a black stork is a replica of the Kuna-hi Ndik-end clan emblem of Aramemb phartry representing a totemic ancestor/animal, whose ritual significance and cultural symbolism are rooted in Marind mythology.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  An image of a black stork is associated with Yawima, one of the Marind mythological rain-magicians, dongan-anem (thunder-maker). The black stork dema is called Manguri.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t The black-and-white stork is a very popular mythical ancestor/animal within Marind myths and ceremonies. The origin of the first stork is mentioned in the myth about one of Geb's sons - snake Uaba. He and his wife Ualiwamb were found by Aramemb (main dema of Aramemb phratry) while engaged in sexual intercourse. Aramemb frees Uaba while a flame shoots from Ualiwamb's vulva (the origin of fire). From there also emerges the first stork, symbol of the initiation and the first cassowary (Van Baal, 1966: 243-245). Ndik is both dema and clan totem linked with clan groupings - Ndik-end and Kuna-hi Ndik-end of Aramemb phratry. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t The stork plays an important role in the myth of the origin of the mankind; the fish-shaped first human beings were picked out from the water by a stork and later shaped into human beings by Aramemb and his fire (ibid.: 209-210).\r\nNdik also plays an important role re-enacted by dema-performer during important mourning rituals of Mayo. The myth episode is re-enacted by two dancing storks and two dog dema-performers (TM-number: 5969-74 and Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 54, Fig. 12 and Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 51, Fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThe stork dema-performer wears a carved stork head ornament, made partly from real stork feathers and partly imitated by sago-leaves stripes. He dances while his hands slowly move up and down imitating the flight of the stork. The performer's face is covered with a mask (a face shield) to which the feathers of cassowary and birds of paradise have been attached. His body is covered with a costume made of fibres.\r\n\r\nThe western Marind people perform during their ritual celebrations the uar-ti-zi, the imo cult dance of the stork's feathers, performed as an equivalent of the eastern waiko-zi, the mayo cult dance. \"It is also preceded by a dema-wir [Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 9], which is opened by a performer representing a hais and wearing the hais-mask... . Then at last the uar-ti-zi performers arrive. ... On their heads they wear a kind of small gari,... . Projecting from the hairdo, a long rod passes through this headgear. At the top are a few storks' feathers, from which the dance derives its name. ... the uar-ti-zi is danced by miakim and married men only. ... Stork's feathers are the distinctive ornaments of the fully initiated men\" (ibid.: 854-855). The dancer has been further decorated with croton leaves and plays a big drum.\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 20.11. 2006" .
