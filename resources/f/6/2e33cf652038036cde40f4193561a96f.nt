In the past the most common cause for etai was the killing of an enemy. Today such victory celebrations and ritual battles are staged for tourists.\r\n\r\nIn Dani society it was a moral obligation for every man to participate in warfare. The spirits of their forefathers participate in daily life and are the protectors of the well-being of the community, as they are for their enemies. The almost never-ending hostilities between the men and spirits of enemy communities took several forms. One type, ritual battles, were pre-mediated, announced battles.  Men suffered injury but it was a formal encounter, to which each side would wear finery and exchange taunts from morning until dusk. Birds featured in the feathered ornaments that were worn and carried (e.g. WM-50908) and the bird sounds made. This was done with the intension of creating a resemblance to the spirits of the deceased, which are strongly associated with birds. -E. Lilje\r\n\r\nBroekhuijse, J.
