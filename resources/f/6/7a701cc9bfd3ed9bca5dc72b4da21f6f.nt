<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7198-19> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This sculpture, though it mobilises familiar traditional elements, is a form that appears to have arisen in the latter part of the 20th century. The introduction and enthusiastic uptake of opportunities to earn income through the sale of works and material culture to art collectors and tourists has prompted many woodcarvers to innovative new forms*. It is likely that for this work David Sebai drew upon a type of ancestor image, kawe, in which the figure is shown in a standing posture, with arms by the side and legs outstretched. Three figures are combined vertically into the carving, whereas historic examples of the standing ancestor, such as can be seen in the collection, were singular (e.g. RV-3070-83, RV-3530-14). He may also have drawn upon the figurative elements that appear on a broad array of carved works, such as, pigment bowls, bisj poles, prows & soul canoes.\r\nAncestor figures were more than an image of the deceased, they were a materialisation of the them. They were used at various festivals to get in touch with the realm of the ancestors and re-invigorate and manage this contact.\r\n\r\n*Catholic missionaries, in the hope of providing economic opportunities and of mitigating the loss of Asmat culture and identity a result of rapid social changes (e.g. through colonialism, missionisation, legal constraints of governments), helped to initiate the Asmat Museum of Culture and Progress in Agats in 1973 and sponsored cultural festivals from 1981 onwards." .
