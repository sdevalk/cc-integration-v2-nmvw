<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-2385-35> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This ceremonial dance ornament represents a pigeon (bevom). It is carved from wood; the beak of the bird is broken off, its hull is round and tail is flat. The top is largely decorated with coix seeds and abrus pips. The eyes of the bird are also indicated by abrus pips. The parts without pips have been painted yellow. There are a few real feathers attached to the body, mainly on the wings and tail. On the bottom there is a hole to which a stick was attached by means of which the ornament was carried above the bearer's head.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\nAccording to the donor, children carried this object attached to a stick during the parade in honour of the marriage of Princess Juliana of the Netherlands.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThis bird ornament is a replica of the Geb-ze-ha clan emblem representing a totemic ancestor/animal, whose ritual significance and cultural symbolism are rooted in Marind mythology.\r\nOne myth tells a story about a man from Dahuk-ze-mirav came with his mother Amus to Habe to fetch the rattan dema.  When Kamina's mother died he buried her body wrapped in banana-leaves. Three day later the grave was reopened and a few pigeons flow out from it. \"The pigeons are one of the Geb-ze totems because they were hatched in banana-leaves\" (Van Baal, 1966: 340).\r\n\r\nThe pigeon dema is very important during the dema-wir (Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 9) celebrations. Wirz (1922-25, IV: 45ff) has described one elaborated dema-wir performance, organized by coastal Marind, which he observed during his first research among Marind people (between 1916-1918). \r\n\"Among the performers we note first a hais, then a stork, then four gari-bearers. Now a yam dema appears, adorned with representations of the vegetable symbolized by him. A pigeon and a cassowary follow. The latter runs up to another performer who carries an obyara-tree, the fruits of which are a favourite food of the cassowary. Then a batend-dema appears, guided by two iwag, his nakari. ...\" (Van Baal, 1966: 857).\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 20.11. 2006" .
