<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-361-58> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Apache shield; Apache; rawhide, feathers, red flannel, black silk, copper, paints; d. 40 cm.; ca. 1880.\r\n\tThis round rawhide shield has a slightly convex front decorated with painted designs and attached feathers and strips of cloth and ribbon. In the center is a black circle outlined in green. Although worn in spots, it appears originally to have had a painted band around the entire circumference: the shield edge was painted red, inside of which was a wide black band, inside of which was a narrow green line. At the bottom are remnants of a few painted feather motifs that extended inward from the green line. Around the upper portion of the shield, just inside the painted border, a red flannel strip was attached with copper tacks that go through the rawhide. Inside that is a black silk ribbon similarly attached with a lesser number of tacks. Inside that is an arc of black feathers tied with sinew to buckskin thongs that can wave freely. The flannel strip extends, unattached, beyond the edge of both sides of the shield, and has attached feathers. When held upright, feathers cover most of the front, with the cloth and feather strips hanging down below each side.\r\n\tThe concave back is completely painted bright red in smeared-on paint. A roughly rectangular strip of harness leather is attached just above the center, with two tacks at the top and one at the bottom. Tied to the bottom tack are some broken strands of vegetal fiber string, suggesting that something may once have been attached there, perhaps small feathers or an amulet of some sort. The shield was collected in June/July 1883 at San Carlos, Arizona.\r\n\tTen Kate (2004:197,216-n.19) noted that Apaches used round leather shields that were \"sometimes painted and adorned with feathers\" and that the feathers on this shield are Corvus americanus (now Corvus brachyrhynchos - American Crow). Although the use of crow feathers on shields is known for the Western Apache, only two feathers were used along with a majority of eagle or hawk feathers (Basso 1971:242); the feathers on Ten Kate's shield appear to be flight feathers from a Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaëtos).\r\n\tThis shield is one of the more important items collected by Ten Kate because shields were few in number and valuable, but also simply because we know when and where it was collected. Of the Apache shields in public and private collections, most have no useful collection history, and their attribution is usually based on construction and the painted designs. It seems probable that Ten Kate obtained this shield at San Carlos, but even if acquired at Camp Apache, at least we know it was collected among Western Apaches. Even that does not completely preclude the shield actually having been made by some other group, but Ten Kate's shield fits well with what we know of other Western Apache shields. They were generally made of a single thickness of rawhide, taken from the neck, shoulder, or hips of a horse, cow or bull. Western Apaches sometimes made buckskin shield covers, but more often did not. Shields were imbued with great protective and concealing powers, and could only be made safely by men with knowledge of the appropriate supernatural power. Shields were not destroyed upon the death of the owner, but were passed on to a relative (Basso 1971:241).\r\n\tIn decoration, Ten Kate's shield shares with four other Western Apache shields (Baldwin 1965:105, Ferg 1987:140-142; Hall 1926:47) an emphasis on a centrally-positioned circle motif, three of them known to be done in either green or black paint. All have eagle feathers attached in some way to the circumference, including two with streamers and attached feathers like Ten Kate's. In short, Ten Kate's shield both compares nicely with the other known Western Apache shields, as well as increases our sample with good collection histories.\r\nTen Kate pointed out that Western Apaches were not communal horseback warriors like Plains tribes, but practiced guerilla warfare, well adapted to the mountain environments of Arizona. Apaches operated in small groups which carried out hit-and-run attacks. A thorough knowledge of the landscape, physical endurance, determination, and courage qualified young men to become respected warriors. Apaches were a hardened people because of their environment and way of life. With a clinical tone (as befits a physical anthropologist) mixed with a touch of romanticism, Ten Kate noted the Apaches' slender but muscular bodies, a gait which he compared to that of a tiger, and a piercing gaze. Many chiefs and warriors showed old scars and recent injuries. At San Carlos, Chief Loco discussed the cause of his five major wounds with the anthropologist, and Ten Kate noted that the left half of Loco's face bore the signs of heavy trauma and that he was blind in his left eye. Chiefs, called nahntáhn, had reputations based on their success in leading raids. However, authority was quickly lost when physical prowess waned, enabling ambitious young warriors to prove themselves and ascend to positions of leadership. Old Nané, and especially Loco, were cases in point. Ten Kate also encountered Eskiminzin, who had fought with Geronimo, but had turned to a quiet life of farming.\r\n\tIn pre-reservation times, bows and arrows were used for hunting, and as weapons in raiding (to steal property) or warfare (to exact revenge by killing people). Lances and clubs were mainly offensive weapons used in war. In early times, arrows and lances were tipped with flaked stone points, replaced in later years with metal points on arrows, and long metal blades on lances, the latter sometimes made from captured Spanish, Mexican, or American cavalry sabers. A distinctly Apache style of clubs for close combat, called zendízj (Ten Kate 2004:197), was made of a spherical stone, the size of a billiard ball, sewn into a rawhide covering and attached by a flexible thong to a handle. In the late 1800s, traditional weapons were almost completely replaced by rifles and handguns, with one, and often two, ammunition belts worn around the waist.\r\n\tFor protection, Apaches carried large, round, rawhide shields. Also worn on raids or in warfare were buckskin caps decorated with eagle, hawk or turkey feathers. Shields and caps were imbued with supernatural power to protect their owner, as were amulets and possibly painted buckskin shirts (see \"Clothing: Protective and Secular\" section above). By the time of Ten Kate's visit, a number of men still owned shields, and caps were still worn for protection against supernatural dangers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVolgens de Apaches bezat een schild magische krachten om mensen te beschermen.\r\nEen schild kon alleen worden gemaakt door mensen die de kennis bezaten om met deze magische krachten om te gaan. Wie zonder deze kennis probeerde om een schild te maken, kon ernstig ziek worden of zelfs dood gaan. Specialisten op dit gebied maakten schilden in opdracht en konden veel geld verdienen. De schilden waren zo duur dat niet iedereen zich een dergelijk schild kon veroorloven. De oorlogsschilden met bovennatuurlijke beschermede kracht werden na het overlijden van de eigenaar vererfd.\r\nDe schilden waren van dik leer gemaakt, afkomstig van de nek, schouder of heupen van de bison.\r\nOp het schild werden beschermende symbolen geschilderd, soms abstract, soms naturalistisch. Kenmerkend is een cirkelvormge figuur in het midden op het schild, de oorsprong van de beschermende bovennatuurlijke kracht.\r\nDe randen van schilden werden versierd met stroken stof en veren van de adelaar.\r\nDe schilden werden opgeborgen in leren foudralen die de Apaches, in tegenstelling tot de Pueblos en Plains Indianen, onbeschilderd lieten.\r\n\r\nDe achterkant van dit schild is fel rood geschilderd en heeft een bruin leren handgreep. De voorkant is beschilderd met een magisch symbol." .
