Mimih spirits are shy and often flee when approached from intruders to their rocky domain. They are usually no threat to human, but are sometimes described as mischievious and dangerous to humans. Mimih's are capable of kidnapping and even killing humans. Clever men, may befriend them to be taught their songs and dance. The exploits of the Mimih spirits are often used to talk about scandalous behaviour in the clan, without pointing directly to those whom it is about." .
