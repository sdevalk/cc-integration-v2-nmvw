For this exhibition, Ehikhamenor expanded on his work in the Nigerian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, by exploring the material form of identity and the intricate connections between history, spirituality and art. In a series of intricate perforated works on paper and a new body of work composed of rosaries sewn on canvases and lace material, Ehikhamenor created elaborate images depicting mythical and royal figures. These works reference the imagery and symbolism of both Edo traditional religion and Catholicism, the dual aesthetic and spiritual traditions which infused the artist’s upbringing.\r\nThe exhibition draws its title from a work of historical fiction by Cuban novelist Alejo Carpentier and uses “marvellous realism” to explore colonial and post-colonial history through the prism of different cultural perspectives, challenging the boundary between reality and narrative. Ehikhamenor’s new work considers themes of colonial and religious hierarchies and the interaction of people, palace and society across the intersecting histories of the Benin Kingdom and the British Empire. \r\nThe work explores Ehikhamenor’s own critical reflections regarding his descent from the Kingdom of Benin, whose sophisticated political culture and artistic tradition has inspired a renewed appreciation of pre-colonial African civilisations. It seems to argue that the mythical nature of all empires makes it possible for the fictional to exist concurrently with the rational, the magical with the realist. Examining the narratives of inferiority used by the British to coerce the Edo people into adopting ideals of Euro-Christian civilization, Ehikhamenor, born after independence, considers the complex relationship between the traditional and the modern." .
