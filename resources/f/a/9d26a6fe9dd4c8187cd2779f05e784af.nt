A large part of the submitted material was only used later, after the First World War, in the Colonial Institute’s jubilee exhibition of 1923 . \r\nOne of the submissions in 1917 was a large number of original glass negatives depicting the Singkep Tin Company in the Riau Archipelago. This company was founded in 1889 and was taken over in 1933 by the large NV Billton Maatschappij. The negatives include images showing the activities in the mines, and studio portraits of the employees. Around 1900 studio portrait in the NV Billton Maatschappij.  Netherlands East Indies was still the preserve of the colonial elite. The indigenous population were photographed as ‘exotic types’ but – exceptions such as the local rulers excluded – not as people with their own identities, and company photographs show labourers on the shop floor, not in a studio. However, employees at the more modern Singkep Tin Company were photographed in a mobile studio that was set up outside and on the shop floor. \r\nThe surroundings can be glimpsed behind and beside the painted backcloth that appears in all the images, leading to the conclusion that it was still technically necessary to take photographs by daylight. \r\nThe Singkep Tin Company thus made it possible for a significant number of its employees to have a professional photographer make a posed portrait made of them. What is noteworthy about these photographs is that the employees, who are depicted with and without their families, are all shown with the same studio attributes. Probably provided by the photographer himself, these attributes provide the viewer – in contrast to portraits in the painterly tradition – with no additional information about the status of the depicted person. The descriptions of the negatives, which accompanied these photographs when they arrived in the Tropenmuseum collection, only note a person’s function and sometimes their ethnicity, but not their name – they remain anonymous. What is left is a series of portraits of unknown but proud men and women. \r\nBron: A. Mansfeld, Photographs of the Netherlands East Indies\r\nat the Tropenmuseum, Amsterdam 2012" .
