<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1485-331> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This wooden figure probably represents an ancestor or relative that recently died. It is carved from one piece of wood. Like all carving work, this was a man's job. \r\nIt shows a male person which stands on a wooden platform with carved patterns on it. The figure  has very short hair. The face is decorated with elaborate carvings, so is the chest. There are plaits around the arms and legs and the man wears a belt. The ears are very big with the earlobes hanging down. The mouth is open and shows teeth. The whole statue is coloured red, while the carvings are coloured in white and black. \r\nThe meaning of these figures is not quite clear apart from that they were always set up in men's houses. One can therefore assume that they represent deceased relatives or clan members. It is set up as a memory of the deceased rather than a resting place for its soul. Other reports say that such figures were placed in front of the men's houses to host the soul of the deceased until his sister has paid a pig for him in the next feast. The soul is then satisfied and leaves the village. The figure is taken down." .
