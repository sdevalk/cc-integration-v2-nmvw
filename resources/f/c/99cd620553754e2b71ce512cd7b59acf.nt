Heated and molten gum from greasewood (Sarcobatus) and arrow weed (Pluchea sericea) secured the wooden handle at one end, not protruding at the upper end (Spier 1955:8). Some rattles were made from pottery, but probably only for external trade. As rhythm instruments rattles were used to keep time during singing, music and dancing, at both social and ceremonial occasions.\r\n\tThe gourd sounding body of the rattle is painted red, over which several broad white lines are applied longitudinally, and one transversely across. In addition, a design is applied in small perforations, following partially the outline of the white cross-bands, enabling the sound to emanate more strongly from the rattle (cf. Spier 1955:9,fig. 2e). It consists of four double vertical lines of pricked holes, transected by one double horizontal line. In all of the eight subsections a triangle of three pricked holes is applied. The loop attached to the handle when Ten Kate collected it was lost in storage.\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)\r\n\r\n\"Agnáhlja ser\". Bij het dansen in gebruik." .
