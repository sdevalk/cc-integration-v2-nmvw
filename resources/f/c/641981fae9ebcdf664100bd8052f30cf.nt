Gegevens over het soort dieren van Mrs. Sandra Holmes, van wie de painting is gekocht.\r\nDe schildering is in Darwin door Sandra Holmes en later nog een keer hier op het museum gefixeerd.\r\nArtist is Yirawala. Dreaming - Barramundi and Goanna. \r\nPainted at Oenpelli.\r\nYirawala (c. 1894-1976) was born at Morgaleetbah near the Liverpool River, about 80 km south of Maningrida, NT, of Gunwinggu descent. He worked for many years as a labourer for 'Top End' timbergetters and prospectors, and for a Chinese market gardener. He established himself as a professional bark painter in the late 1940s and early 50s, after moving to Croker Island, where the Methodist mission bought and marketed his output. Yirawala rose to fame through his friendship with Sandra Holmes, who promoted his work. He was awarded the MBE in 1971 for his services to Aboriginal art, and the same year received the International Art Cooperation Award. An exhibition of his paintings was held at the Sydney Opera House in 1975, and collections of his works were acquired by the Mus√©e de l'Homme in Paris and the Reserve Bank in Sydney. In the years before he died, Yirawala became active in the land rights movement. At the time of his death, he was planning a return to his homeland to protest against the possibility of mining there. He died on Croker Island and was buried there. \r\n\r\nDr. Ian Howie-Willis. In: David Horton (ed.). 1994. In: The Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.
