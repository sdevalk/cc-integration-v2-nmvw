(w. handle); 2012-7: from Tesuque or Santa Clara; micaceous pottery; d. 6.5 cm., h. 6 cm.; 1883.\r\nClay rich with mica was commonly used in northern New Mexico to make cooking pots because of its ability to withstand thermal shock from repeated use on an open fire.  It was commonly used by all of the Northern Rio Grande pueblos beginning ca. 1300 and continued to be popular until ca. 1900 when its use was suspended at all but Taos and Picuris Pueblos. Today there has been a resurgence of interest in micaceous clay and it is used by a variety of groups for utilitarian purposes, as well as the production of figurines and art pottery (Anderson 1999). The clay used for RMV 2012-5 with loop handle contains much mica, and the surface exhibits fireclouds.\r\nBlack wares (Tewa Polished Black) were common to all of the Northern Rio Grande pueblos after ca. 1300 (cf. Stevenson 1883:fig. 656-659, 660-672; 1883a:443-447; Batkin 1987:36,40,66,69,75-76). In addition villages had polychrome, black-on-white, micaceous, corrugated, and plain wares, all for different purposes including storage, cooking, serving, and ceremonial use. The manufacture of black pottery died out in most pueblos early in the 20th century. However, black wares have received a good deal of revived attention at Santa Clara and San Ildefonso since the 1920s when Maria and Julian Martinez (San Ildefonso) began making their famous black-on-black art pottery.\r\n(Anderson 2008-09)\r\n\r\nzie serie 2043, 91-36" .
