<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-5526-23> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "A vessel flute made from coconut shell, named ‘kutagwa’ and associated with the female spirits bearing the same name.  It is played by side-blowing and if the instrument has additional holes, its tone can be changed by their closing and opening.\r\nIn Abelam region these flutes are played during the male initiations and particularly their first phase, when they are  also ceremonially shown to the initiates together with some other sacred objects. This phase is followed by the more advanced one associated with the Naggwalandu – the most important clan ancestor This succession of phases reflects the transition of an individual from the female to male realm. \r\n\r\nOne of the main functions of the flutes, that they share with other instruments, used in initiations, is to warn women and uninitiated men away from the initiation activities. \r\nOrigins myth:\r\nThe myth of their origins accounts a story of some young men who fell asleep near pools of water inhabited by Wale – the water spirits.  They dreamed about the sound and the shape of these instruments and on awakening knew how to make them.  Water in Abelam and Arapesh cultures bears associations with femininity, procreation, birth and death, and the myth of the origins of musical instruments exemplifies the transmutation of these symbols  from the female to the male domain." .
