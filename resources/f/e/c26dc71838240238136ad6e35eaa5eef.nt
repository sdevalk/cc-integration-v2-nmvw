<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1181-30> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The ladle is made of half a coconut shell and a wooden ladle. The hollowed out and smoothed coconut is parted in half (not necessarily evenly). A carved wooden ladle of different size and adornment is glued to the coconut. The manufacture was the work of the men, as is almost all carving  and wood work. \r\nDifferent kinds of adornments can be identified. They most probably don't have a special meaning, but are an expression of the artist's creativity. This ladle is not finished, as it hasn't been polished and coloured yet. \r\nThis handle is glued to the outside of the coconut and it sticks out in a right angle to the rim of the coconut. The back is curved and shows some openwork." .
