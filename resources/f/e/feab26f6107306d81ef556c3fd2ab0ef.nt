<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7224-1> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "`Ruwatan Tanah Air Beta', meaning `Purifying my homeland' is a painting made by Indonesian artist Zico Albaiquni (1987) for the exhibition: On the Nature of Botanical Gardens, at Framer Framed, platform voor kunst en cultuur in Amsterdam (Januari – August 2020) curated by Sadiah Boonstra.\r\nIt shows the different layers and stories of the Kebon Raya Bogor (the national botanical garden) in order to question colonial constructed meanings, and to link with earlier practices, stories and histories. The Kebon Raya Bogor was called ‘s Lands Plantentuin in the colonial era and used as a cultivation garden for tropical crops, trees and plants. In the painting Albaiquni shows different era’s and places in order to shift the perspective of the viewer. Three scenes are taken from images in the collection of the NMvW, from different era’s and places in the garden. The color style that is used is taken from the Mooi Indië style and reminds particularly of the paintings of Leo Eland. \r\n\r\nOn the left is a statue of Nandi (the mount of Shiva), stones and a so called Batu Tulis, a stone with inscriptions. Those refer to holy places at the end of the 19th century in the botanical garden. According to the artist: “this batu tulis was made by an archeologist in the 19th Century, his name is Dr. Friedrich or maybe Georg Karl Reinwardt himself. The text could be read as  “Tidak jauh dari sini ada kolam” / \"not far from here there is a pond / small lake\". But since there is not much accessible notes for the people there, this \"batu tulis\" creates a new meaning, for a lot of people they thought this functions as a treasure clue. Also the Nandi statue itself  today is interpreted with  \"Sunda Wiwitan\" (but this term also need more research, since there's a lot of school of thought and methods) the belief as a representation of  Mundinglaya (The crown prince of Prabu SIliwangi) , and it is installed in Sunda Wiwitan way and it is become a “totem” and being activated as part of Sunda wiwitan rituals”. So it is not put in a museum, where it becomes sterile  (end of quote of the artist). \r\n\r\nAlbaiquni took the scene from a photograph he has made himself, and similar older photographs are also in the collection of the museum. \r\n\r\nThe group of dancing people is taken from a photograph of a schoolclass visiting the botanical garden in Bogor. Another picture shows members of this group seated and mentioning that this is a schoolclass in the botanical garden. \r\n\r\nIn the central pavilion, President Soekarno is seated and in front of him is a monument to commemorate the Panca Sila (the five principals of Indonesian political philosophy) and are references to the Indonesian Republic. These kind of green trash bins are nowadays placed in the garden. \r\nAlbaiquni was present during a ritual cleansing in this pavilion, to show local spirits his good intentions and start conversations on religion, tradition, cultures and histories of Java. The shaman is one of his relatives. According to me he is thus inviting the viewer to have a different view on the botanical garden, which can be seen as a purification ritual of these past histories. The museum has several photographs of this pavilion as well in the collection. \r\n\r\nThe graveyard on the right is taken from elements of the Dutch cemetery in the Botanical garden painted by Raden Saleh, which is in the NMvW collection (TM-0-432). According to the exhibition catalogue, the bamboo planted there is to calm the spirits of the Dutch people who were burried there. \r\n\r\nThe flat baskets in the foreground refer to basic values, an artwork of the Dutch artist Herman de Vries (Biennale, Venice; Erasmus Huis Jakarta; 2015 & Framer Framed, Amsterdam 2016) in which De Vries questions the relationships that exist between nature and culture, and the ways in which they affect and influence one another. Albaiquni wants to show another view with this reference as in West Java, rice can symbolize prosperity, hope and fertility. This image may also reflect the big round leaves of the Victoria Regia in the ponds of the botanical gardens. The two gentlemen standing near the graveyard are also taken from a photograph of the museum collection. \r\n\r\nThe artist wrote a personal story on the ceremony and the painting:\r\nZico Albaiquni: Ruwatan Tanah Air Beta, Reciting Rites in It’s Site\r\n\r\nThis work began when I held a ceremony based on traditional ritual of ruwatan at Kebun Raya Bogor (Bogor Botanical Garden), located in the vicinity of Jakarta, Indonesia. Ruwatan is a form of ritual in Sundanese (native ethnic of West Java) tradition to cleanse the world from bad omen, reconnect with the nature, the spirits of the ancestors, and God. The traditional ritual involves offerings of natural produce such as beans, rice, tobacco, and held prayers in the site. I chose Kebun Raya Bogor as the site of this work for its historical value in Indonesia’s history as well as its cultural value for the Sundanese people. For centuries, the site’s significance has been evolving in relation to its social and cultural situation that encompasses it. According to the Sundanese history, the original site (called Samida) was man-made forest intended as botanical conservation area and also used by Prabu Siliwangi, the celebrated Sundanese King of the 15th century, to practice asceticism. During the 18th century, the Dutch East India Company build a palace inside the area and in 1811 Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles used it as his residence. Later the forest was converted into a botanical garden. Since the Indonesian independence in 1945, the area has been used as one of the Presidential Palace and the botanical garden was opened to public and used as scientific research facility.  This area is a witness of history, a manifestation of collective memory that encompassed three different culture and history: the Sundanese, the colonial, and the nation of Indonesia and it keep evolving as time moves forward. The ruwatan ceremony I held is a symbolic act to illustrate my clean intention and an attempt to open up conversation about remembering, connecting and reimagining different cultures, traditions, beliefs, and the history of Java.\r\nDuring my ruwatan process, I discovered number of objects, which represents the how the different cultures perceive and creates their own meaning of these objects. I remember visiting Herman de Vries’ exhibitions at Venice Biennale (2015), Italy and Erasmushuis, Jakarta in (2015) where it evoked my perspective in looking at sensitive colonial relationship between Indonesia and the Netherland. This colonial history rarely discussed openly and often bring an endless suspicion. In Herman de Vries’ book, Basic Values, he listed different types of rice to illustrates the biological wealth of Java. Meanwhile in Sundanese tradition, this rice carries its own sacred meaning and commonly used in ruwatan. Another object, a stone statue, was documented by the Dutch (and the photograph is currently in the collection of Tropenmuseum numbered as RV-1403-3790-1). The statue is described as a statue of Hindu guardian deity, Nandi. Meanwhile in Sundanese spiritual beliefs of Sunda Wiwitan, the statue is seen as a representation of Mundinglaya, the prince in Sundanese folklore. Today the statue has been rearranged and used by the Sundanese as sacred ritual site. Another object is a gazebo built by the Dutch during colonial time in one of the sacred locations in Sundanese tradition. After the independence, the Indonesian government build a totem in front of the gazebo, inscribed with Pancasila (the nation’s Five Principle) and named it as Paniisan Soekarno, referring Indonesia’s founding father and the first president. Last spot that I found interesting is a Dutch cemetery complex inside the Kebun Raya Bogor, near Merdeka Palace. This location was painted by Raden Saleh in Het Kerkhof in het Park te Bogor met Graven (1871). Today, the cemetery become a park with children playground and decorated by with bamboo. According to the spiritual community there, the bamboo is used to keep the Dutch spirits happy and feel at home because bamboo was traditionally used for spiritual protection for the living and the dead.\r\n\r\nRuwatan is originally a spiritual ceremony but in my work, I used it not only as a metaphysical activity and symbolic ritual but also as an artistic action to reconnect our physical world with our spirituality, activating our collective memory, transferring knowledge, revisit history, and reimagining the future. To conclude the work, I created a painting that encapsulates my journey and the artistic process I have underwent during the ruwatan.\r\n\r\nThe title explanation\r\nThe term Tanah Air: the sites of Kebun Raya Bogor is not exclusively held to represent the idea of Republik Indonesia. But this site already existed before the colonial period, during the colonial period and when the idea of Republik Indonesia was tested. I actually try to find all the groups or people that create or made their relation to the idea of Tanah Air.\r\nIn the title the artist uses the word ‘beta’ instead of the usual ‘saya’ or ‘(a)ku’ (meaning ‘mine’). When he was asked why he used this he answered: “But for some reason in my generation it creates a nostalgic effect, when it is put with the \"Indonesia Tanah Air\". It have the feeling of the time of Indonesian Independence generation. The text is related to and taken from the first verse of the lagu wajib nasional \"Indonesia Pusaka\" (the compulsory national song: “Indonesia sacred heritage”) by Ismail Marzuki. But one other reason that I used the term beta, is also because of the term beta test in software development. Beta Testing of a product is performed by \"real users\" of the software application in a \"real environment\" and can be considered as a form of external User Acceptance Testing." .
