(double) 56 cm.; feathers: l. 8-16 cm.; ca. 1880.\r\n\tTen Kate (1885/2004:450/216) noted \"A head ornament of the Apaches-Yumas present at the same place [San Carlos, AZ] consists of feathers of the wild turkey and A. chrysaëtos.\" Ten Kate was fully aware that the term \"Apache-Yuma\" was a nineteenth-century misnomer for Yavapai groups. In addition to referring to the \"Apache-Yumas,\" he states that they call themselves Yavepé-Kutchán, Yavapai-Yumas (Ten Kate 2004:208). There are several references (Drucker 1941:116; Gifford 1932:228; 1936:278) of Yavapai boys or men wearing one or two feathers in their hair for ornamentation, but Ten Kate's specimen, consisting of turkey (Meleagris) and two Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) feathers, looks more elaborate than that, but nevertheless is of exceedingly simple construction. He collected it at San Carlos, presumably from a Yavapai Indian living among them." .
