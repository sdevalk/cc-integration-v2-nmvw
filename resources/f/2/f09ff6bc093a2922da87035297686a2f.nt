<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/2b6ac98362f99262a87a094f7730f3a7> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Oryun haengsilto (het gedrag volgens de vijf ethische codes, d.w.z. de relatie tussen bestuurders en burgers, man en vrouw, oud en jong, ouder en kind en vrienden onderling) volume 4, educatief boek met confucianistische teksten ter lering van vrouwen. De uitwerkingen van de vijf principes in illustraties met Chinese en Koreaanse tekst.\r\n\r\nWomen, to pay respect to authority and consensus in a Confucian patriarchy, must pay even higher price. As a woman in a Confucian culture, the less you talk, the more virtuous you are. Women, in a traditional society, must subject their will to that of male members in a family such as father, husband and son. That was 'the tao of 3 ways of following (samjongjido)' in Confucian culture. In the Choson period, the law says that even when women did something to be punished, it was their male patrons (including sons) that were punished. Underlying is the assumption that a woman could not be an autonomous moral being who can make judgements on her own and be responsible for her own conduct.\r\n\r\nThis book 'oryun haengshilto kwŏn sam mongnok', illustrations of five ethics for virtuous behaviours, volume 3' consists of the examples of virtuous women and episodes to educate people in a Confucian society. Even though the historical scholarship on Choson dynasty has been based almost exclusively on texts in classical Chinese, produced and consumed by the elite male, this book has illustrations and Korean versions of texts." .
