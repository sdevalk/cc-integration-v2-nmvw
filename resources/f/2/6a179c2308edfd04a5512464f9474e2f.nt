<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/803e98fa813636bcc5e67dea3ad3cc0c> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This is a model of a typical wooden bed. A life-sized bed is part of the collection as well (2802-95). This copy has two side pieces which end in a crocodile's head on the one side and in the tail on the other. Two neck rests lie next to the bed. One of them was stuck onto the frame near the crocodile's heads for the neck or head to rest on it. The bed is coloured red and has engraved patterns on the sides which are coloured white and black.\r\nThe beds were used as resting place, but also had a ceremonial function. It was used for weddings where the adorned bride was carried to her husband's house on such a bed. The bed was then part of the dowry. It is not sure whether sleeping beds and ceremonial beds had different designs or special motifs. \r\nDuring the day, beds would also serve as chairs and tables.\r\n\r\nThe model was very likely only produced to sell it to the Europeans." .
