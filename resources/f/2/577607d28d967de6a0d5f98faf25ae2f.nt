Dog teeth were valuable because of their scarcity. The glass beads were introduced by European traders and often replaced traditional shell or coconut beads. The beads and teeth are presumably threaded on new wire, but this is not sure.\r\nThe necklace is worn by women and men and mostly worn for ceremonies." .
