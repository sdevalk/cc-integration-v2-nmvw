First, long leaves from the Pandanus tree are softened on the fire and always two of them are sewn together on the short side. They are then folded along the seam. Approximately 20-25 of those strips are then sewn together on the long side to make a mat. The edges are then closed. \r\nThese mats were carried above the head and gave protection from the rain. \r\nThey could also have served as protection from looks, as some people were not allowed to be seen in certain phases or situations. This could for example be a woman in her seclusion phase before marriage or little boys and girls after an ear- or nose piercing  ceremony." .
