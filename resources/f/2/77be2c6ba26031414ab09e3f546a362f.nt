Schmeltz 1903; beschrijvingskaart)\r\n\r\nBromhout (cora of boonaugharry), gelijkend op no. 1207-14.\r\n\r\nShould a native die, the relatives show their grief by striking their heads with flint stones and mihras [see No's: 1207-7,1207-9 and 1321-66), until the blood flows freely. They prostrate themselves upon the body screaming and howling, then walking a few yards throw themselves again and again upon the ground, giving vent to their feelings by groans and shrieks. The boonangharrie's [see No's: 1207-14, 1321-47 and 1321-48] are swung to drive the djuno away, as he is the cause of death. They do not believe in death by natural causes.\r\n\r\nIn a month's time, (the next new-moon) the whole tribe has assembled, and on a given signal by one of the elders, the candidates for circumcision are suddenly pounced upon by the men, their arms are tied firmly to the body by human hair strings, whilst the \"boonangharries\" of \"Devil-scarers\" [see No's: 1207-14, 1321-47 and 1321-48] are violently swung in the camp, to keep the \"djuno\", or Evil-spirit away.\r\n\r\nThe boys are painted all over with \"wilgie\" or red-ochre, and are then fed by the old women with various grass-seeds, pounded and ground to a pulp on the \"mijarra\", [see No. 1207-96] and moistened with water (baba), or baked in little cakes in the hot ashes. Meat is not allowed them on this occasion.\r\n\r\nAt night, huge fires are kindled, and the elders sit around them with the candidates, teaching them the laws and traditions of the tribes, the boundaries of their territory, the reasons of their feuds with other tribes etc., etc., and the strict lines of their future conduct are clearly laid down for them.\r\n\r\nRitual songs and dances are taught and performed, their significance explained and the mystery of the \"tarlow\"and its ceremonial expounded.\r\n\r\nThe \"una\" or hunting dance of the men, and the dance of the old women, the \"tubagéh\", are danced every night around the camp-fire, accompanied by the rattling of spears and kailis [see No's: 1207-46 and 1321-44], and the incessant roaring of the boonangharries [see No's 1207-14, 1321-47 and 1321-48] and the monotonous songs of the old men.\r\n\r\nThe \"nambéh\", or circumcision-song is taught to them, so that they may sing it on the day of the actual ceremony.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of healing they may go into the bush unattended, but on returning, must swing the boonangharry [see No's: 1207-14, 1321-47 and 1321-48] to give notice of their approach, so that the young women and children may run to their camp and hide, as otherwise they would suffer great pain and the process of healing would be breatly retarded." .
