At the upper end the skewers are glued together with a mass of Parinarium nut. The Parinarium is coloured with red from the mbuhul plant. The skewers are held apart with four horizontal bars, which were normally removed after the handle had been coated and the skewers would remain in their position.\r\nThis comb was used primarily for hair care, as it is not decorated. \r\nIt was mostly used by men, as women often had short hair or were bald." .
