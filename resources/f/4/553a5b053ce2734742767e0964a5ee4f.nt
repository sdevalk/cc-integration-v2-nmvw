First the brown fibres are plaited and are then embroidered on the surface with a yellow fibre which makes \"v\"s.\r\nIt is worn by men and women on the upper arm. Two bands are worn on one arm, one high up and one just above the elbows. \r\nThe production is the job of only the women. These kind of arm bands are characteristic for the Admiralty Islands. The bright yellow colours and their contrast to the dark fibres makes them so popular, especially for women. The patterns are very elaborate and the manufacturing time-consuming, therefore they are prestigious." .
