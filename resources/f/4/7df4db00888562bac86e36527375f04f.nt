Although few similar works appear to have\r\nreached museums, the collector reported that on Kadai village the meeting house featured a whole assembly of stone images of this\r\nkind. Elsewhere in Oceania, in the Marquesas lslands for example, low walls supporting house platforms or marking out ritual precincts often incorporated sculpted stones representing tiki, ancestors or deities. The representation of a group of figures or a scene on a relief is, however. uncommon.\r\n(Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts, p.282)" .
