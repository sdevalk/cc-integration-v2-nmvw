Versierd met parallelsgewijs ingesneden verticale groeven en dwarsgroeven die elkaar kruisen.  De ingesneden figuren hebben hun betekenis, men brengt daardoor bepaalde mededelingen over.\r\n\r\nA short stick of light coloured wood with a series of short, narrow grooves or notches, 'V'-shaped in section, cut along the sides giving the piece of wood a quadrangular cross section. These cuts are reminiscent of 'tally grooves', and of the series of short grooves found on rock engraving sites in the Grafton district of the Clarence valley, and in north-eastern South Australia. Such rock engravings are not found in the Richmond River district. The longer grooves on the message sticks are cut on nopposed sides (nineteen on one, twenty on the other) as are also the shorter grooves (fourteen on one side, thirteen on the other). The message stick measures 9.9 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm.\r\n\r\nThe pair of message sticks is a unique specimen. No other examples from this ara are known, and there is only one reference to their use in the local literature. Bray (1923:7) mentions that 'messages from tribe to tribe were carried verbally except very important ones. This [sic] were marked on a stick by means of notches'. To the south we have records of their use at Port Stephens (Scott 1929:33-4), but unfortunately no description of their features. To the north in Queensland such stick were used, and there are surviving examples in the Queensland Museum's collections. Some of these bear notches, as do the Richmond River specimens, though the particular examples do not come from south-east Queensland (see Hamlyn-Harris 1918:19, 20, 26, 27). Such message sticks apparently served a double purpose; they were 'memory sticks' for the bearer, and guarantees of his good faith as he travelled through the territory of different tribal groups. There seems to be little information on their use in eastern New South Wales, though they are reasonably well documented for other areas such as the Darling basin and central Australi (Hamlyn-Harris 1918; Howitt 1904:678-710)." .
