<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/146aef823533241b15c9dddbeec993c8> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The original stele for this rubbing in the Xian Beilin. It was painted by a monk named Feng Dian who lived during the Qing Dynasty and then inscribed on the stele. Bodhidharma sits on the with a Buddhist alms bowl in his hand and meditates while facing the wall.\r\n\r\nThe motif of \"Dharma facing the wall\" stems from a popular legend of Bodhidharma in ancient China. It is said that during the period of Northern and Southern dynasties the Indian monk Dharma came to the Shaolin Temple in Henan province and settled down to face the wall all day long for about nine years in order to do meditation. Dharma is considered as the founder of Zen in China.\r\n\r\nThe only references to the monk Fengdian are in the local records of his hometown Yongdeng in the province of Gansu. Fengdian's birthname was Li Fu. He was born in 1651 and married at 14 years old. Just 4 years after his marriage, he left his wife, cut off his fingers and converted to Buddhism. After becoming a monk he travelled the country while helping poor people and fighting social ills. It was said that he was very good at painting the portrait of Dharma and always painted them after getting drunk.\r\n\r\nJing Tan, 2008." .
