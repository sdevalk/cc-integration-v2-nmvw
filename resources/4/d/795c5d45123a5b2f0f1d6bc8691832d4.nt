<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-3025-38> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Represenation of the goddess Bhubaneswari, who is the fourth among the ten Mahavidya goddesses in Shaktism and one of the highest aspects of Mahadevi. Her attributes are the noose and the goad. Vogel's annotation on the reverse, which indicates Svanesvari, is an error of attribution. The goddess was identified by Vijay Sharma, an artist and art historian in Chamba, Himachal Pradesh. In Bekhli village, Kullu district, Himachal Pradesh, there is a dedicated temple to Devi Bhuvneshvari where she is known as Mata Bhuvneshvari Jagannathi. The temple is constructed of wood with carvings on the exterior. Fairs are held there in respect to the deity twice a year.\r\nDe vierarmige godin zit op een lotus, die op een groene veld bij een rivier  ligt.  Een gouden stralenkrons omringt haar gekroonde hoofd. Zij  vertoont de handhoudingen van bescherming en van  gunstverlening. Haar attributen : de drietand en de olifantenhaak, tesamen met haar derde oog, verwijzen naar de relatie met Devi of Parvati, de gemalin van Siva." .

<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-3025-38> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#material> "voltooide schildering op papier\r\n\r\nthe vasli or thick painting support made from a lamination of two Indian handmade paper sheets; opaque watercolour and imitation of gold paint. \r\nFinished  painting of the goddess Bhubaneswari, surrounded by borders initially painted in pink. The upper part of the support is covered with drops and splashes of a red material. The latter has not been identified but could be some sort of red paint. Because they are so many traces of use (stains, marks and delimination of the painting support along the edges), the painting was probably an object of devotion that was venerated during worship or cult  in a private sphere. \r\nVerso: The name of the goddess was handwritten with black ink by Vogel himself . \r\nOld label from Vogel's collection. \r\nFor more details see attached pfd conservation  report." .
