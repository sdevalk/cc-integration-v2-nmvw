The hollowed out and smoothed coconut is parted in half (not necessarily evenly). A carved wooden ladle of different size and adornment is glued to the coconut. It is attached on the outside. The manufacture was the work of the men, as is almost all carving  and wood work. \r\nDifferent kinds of adornments can be identified. They most probably don't have a special meaning, but are expressions of the artist's creativity. Animal or human figures are probably an allusion to ancestral beings and totems. The handle is glued to the coconut shell on the inside. A whole human figure is carved out of the wood in a naturalistic style. It represents a man who is standing in some platform. One can easily see the details of the face, the arms, legs , feet and ears. The arms and legs are decorated with arm rings just as they are worn in reality. The ladle is coloured red and some details as well as the decorated platform are painted white. The legs are apart and slightly bent.\r\n\r\nThe ladle was used to scoop liquids and solid food from pots and kettles, often from a big wooden bowl. This was often done on feasts, to give out soup to guests. The ladles were kept in the house of the men and were sometimes a present to guests." .
