Gnalluma-tribe, Sherlock-river?\r\n\r\nAll the tribes of N. W. Australia practise cirumcision.\r\nWhen the boys are about 14 years old, an Invitation-stick (gilliana or cugina, [see No's: 1321-32 and 1321-33] is carried round from family to family, scattered over the territory of the tribe at the various waterholes and hunting grounds, and a meeting-place is appointed upon a certain new-moon, to which men, women and children repair.\r\n\r\nIn a month's time, (the next new-moon) the whole tribe has assembled, and on a given signal by one of the elders, the candidates for circumcision are suddenly pounced" .
