They represent a fusion of traditional Indian artistic styles with conventions and technical features borrowed from western art. Some Company paintings were specially commissioned, while others were virtually mass-produced and could be purchased in bazaars.\r\nThis example depicts the tomb of Itimad ud-Daula, the title given to Mirza Ghiyath Beg, a senior court official under the Mughal Emperor Jahangir (r.1605-1628). It was the first building to be constructed entirely of marble in Mughal India and was designed by his daughter." .
