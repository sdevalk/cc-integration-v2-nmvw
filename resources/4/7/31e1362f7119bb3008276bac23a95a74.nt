Krishna, as he is pictured here, is a young child/toddler. The baby and child form of Krishna is a particularly popular form of the god among Hindus around the world. Krishna's mythology involves many playful and naughty episodes from his childhood, where in his innocence he reveals his divinity. For example, in one story, Krishna is scolded by his mother for eating dirt while he is outside playing, when she opens his mouth to remove it, she sees inside it the entire universe contained. \r\n\\" .
