The player who lands on a station marked with the word Stay, tomaru, has to skip one turn. The winner is the first to reach Kyoto as the final station of the Tôkaidô Road. Understandably, such board games have hardly survived. Otherwise it is interesting to note that even an artist of Hiroshige’s stature was not ashamed to design such a game." .
