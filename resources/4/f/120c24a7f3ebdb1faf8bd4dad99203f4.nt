<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-02-1093> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "\"Portrait of Hanshan and Shide in Inscription\" (Hanshan Shide hua xiang)\r\n\r\n      This painting is inscribed on the back side of Buddha's portrait in Da Xiong Bao Dian (the Jeweled Palace of the Great Hero) of the famous temple \"Han Shan Si\" in Suzhou. Hanshan and Shide were two well-known monks in Chinese Buddhistic history and they gained fame not only from their extraordinary behaviors but also from their dialogues and poems full of wisdom and philosophy. It was said that Hanshan and Shide were incarnations of Manjusri Bodhisattva (Wei Shu) and Samantabhadra Bodhisattva (Pu Xian), respectively. Hereby, let's take a look at one of their peculiar philosophical dialogues to get a lively impression of their wisdom. \r\nHanshan asks: What should I do if there is some person who slanders me, badgers me, humiliates me, teases me, despises me, disdains me, dislikes me, betrays me on purpose?\r\nShide answers: How about to bear him, to stand him, to tolerate him, to avoid him, to abide him, to respect him, to ignore him? After several years in doing so, you'll see.\r\n     In this stone inscription of \"Portrait of Hanshan and Shide\", the two figures are represented so lively, but just depicted by simple lines. Hanshan is pointing to the floor with his right hand and Shide seems to be listening to him. Both of them are smiling as if they are talking about the poem shown above in this painting. It's a philosophical  poem but written in a humorous style and very simple words.  It intends to tell people to keep optimist when facing the real life full of trouble, but not to bother oneself too much. There is always bright side of the life and whether one can see it depends on one's own attitude.\r\n\r\n    The painter of this work is Luo Pin (1733-1799) of Qing Dynasty, one member of \"Yangzhou Ba Guai\" (Eight Weirds in Yangzhou), who were a group of artists famous of their peculiarity. Luo Pin never lived an official career in his own life and liked travelling very much. He was good at many subjects' painting such as people, portrait of Buddha, mountains and rivers, flours and fruits, plums, orchids or bamboos, etc. He's portraits are characterized by strong strokes and simple colour. He preferred representing to presenting and   exaggerated somehow in drawing  people's expression  to catching their interior temperament but not  just physical look.  Moreover, he paid much attention to details of people's gestures and clothes in order to express their mentality through these exterior representations.  \r\n\r\nhttp://baike.baidu.com/view/14738.htm\r\nhttp://www.gg-art.com/famous/more.php?exhibitionid=148\r\nhttp://www.cnart.biz/cnart/gu_dai/luopin/china--artist.htm\r\nhttp://bbs.cctv.com/forumthread.jsp?id=8407697\r\nhttp://www.hanshansi.org/guchaxx.asp?gc_leibie=%CB%C2%D4%DE&gc_id=119\r\n\r\nJing Tan, 2008." .
