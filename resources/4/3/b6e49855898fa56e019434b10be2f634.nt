Today Flagstaff House houses the Museum of Tea Ware. \r\nFlagstaff House had been named as Headquarter House until 1932. There is some disagreement as to who designed it, but it was completed in 1846 and initially served as the military headquarters office and residence of the Commander of the British forces in Hong Kong.[1] The site chosen was a small bluff above the barracks and above Queen's Road, then at the waterfront" .
