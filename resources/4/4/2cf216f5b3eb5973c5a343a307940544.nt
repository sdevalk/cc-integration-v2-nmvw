<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/bcd87c97eda4c02fdd92a2fff6d74a4e> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This poster is labelled in English as Diwali pujan, which is a reference to the holiday of Diwali.\r\nThis poster shows two depictions of the goddess and the god Ganesha. On the left hand side, there is the goddess Saraswati, known as the goddess of knowledge. She is distinct because she is depicted with a veena, which is a South Asian musical instrument. She is also considered to be the goddess of music. In the middle, we see Lakshmi, recognisable because of the silver and gold coins that are emanating from her hands, and she is the goddess of wealth. On the right we see Ganesha, the most popular Hindu god in the pantheon today (and the most widely worshipped worldwide), who is considered the remover of obstacles. This poster makes use of a hybrid aesthetics that is conditioned by British-taught ideas on perspective and landscape." .
