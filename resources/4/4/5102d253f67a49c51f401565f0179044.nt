Gebruikt voor lichaamsbeschildering, tevens een belangrijk ruilmiddel\r\n\r\nAfter a weeks or tendays feeding and dancing, the boys, who during that time were not allowed to see a young woman or child of either sex, nor to go unaccompanied by men into the bush, are taken away from the camp, to a place prepared for the actual operation.\r\n\r\nThis place is a circular space cleared of shrubs, grass and stones, having in the centre a large couch of branches, grass and leaves. The men painted in full war-paint with butungu and gilba, their hair tied back from the forehead with hair strings, suddenly seize the youths, throw them down on the couch, and perform the operation with a Stone-knife called \"borulla\" or \"cundemarra\". The fathers never operating upon their own sons.\r\n\r\nWhilst this is going on, the women set up a frightful howl in their camp, which they are not allowed to leave." .
