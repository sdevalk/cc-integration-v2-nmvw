Poson are important part of everyday life. People add to the beauty of the hanbok, Korean traditional costume, and the quality of their stitching reflects on the class background of their wearer. \r\n\r\nAll the lines of the poson sweep together to meet in a hooked peak at the toe. No part of the poson resembles its corresponding part on the foot closely. Since it fits snug, the poson does not come off easily once it is on. When taken off, it retains its attractive form. In fact, though originally for the foot, it can also serve as a decorative piece for a room. \r\n\r\nThe paper pattern used to make a well-fitting poson was an essential feature of every woman's trousseau in traditional society. In fact, the well-bred woman's trousseau included a special cloth back to hold her poson pattern, and careful attention was taken to make the pattern itself as pretty as possible. \r\n\r\nPoson are made of four layers of white cotton fabric between which thin layers of cotton wadding are quilted. Each time the poson are washed, the wadding must be removed and requilted. The sewing and washing of poson were perpetual tasks for all Korean women just a generation ago. \r\n\r\nWith the growing popularity of western style clothing over the last several decades, poson have fallen out of favour. Shops specializing in poson making all closed by the end of the 1980's. Poson-making has become a minor cottage industry, and the old poson shops are a thing of the past." .
