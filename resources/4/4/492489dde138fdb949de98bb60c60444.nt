<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/42ae1e709e53b8dba748c3cf788457c6> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This poster features most prominently a visualisation of the former head of the Indian National Army, Subhash Chandra Bose (1897-1945). He was an Indian nationalist who was once the leader of the Indian National Congress. During WWII, Bose tried to break with British rule with help of Nazi Germany and Japan, which is why he has in the past been seen as a controversial character. However, Hindu Nationalists today consider Bose to be a hero. Here, the phrase he coined in Hindi 'Jai Hind' is written: this translates to 'Victory to India'. Bose's likeness and his slogan is here imposed on a background more recent: it is likely that the other images are of the Indian army (between 1950-2002) are shown here fighting or defending territory. It seems most likely that this is related to the disputed territory of Kashmir. This poster is therefore a work of Indian nationalism and well as propaganda to feed the ongoing conflict between India and Pakistan, which, since the time of India's independence (1947) has a conflict zone, a sight of multiple military conflicts between India and Pakistan." .
