The long stem is laid in a concentric spiral which is tied together with leaves. It has high a narrow opening at the top and a bulgy middle. The woven basket is coated with a thick, moist mass of Parinarium to make it waterproof and more stable. First, the inner side is coated, then the outer side. The basket is put in the sun to dry, where it gets its dark brown colour. The surface is then smoothened. This kind of bowl is almost indestructible and therefore frequently used. Cracks can easily be repaired.  \r\nBasketry-making was the job of men. \r\nThese bowls were used for food consummation, especially the serving of soup. They were probably used by women and men of lower rank, while men of high rank would rather use wooden bowls. \r\nWhile in seclusion, a young woman should not eat out of this kind of bowls, but rather from wooden or earthenware bowls." .
