Bone work was especially plentiful in Halonawan, Hawikuh and other Zuni ancestral sites, and Frederick Webb Hodge published a topical study on the subject. The inventory of bone artifacts from Hawikuh included awls, needles, pins, weaving tools, spindle whorls, chisels, knives, polishers, tubes, flutes, whistles, bird-calls, beads, hooks, gaming pieces, effigies, rings, pendants, etc. Three types of bone awls, made from the bones of small mammals and birds, mostly turkeys, are distinguished: unworked splinters, partial bird or animal bones with unmodified butt, and bones with carefully modified tips and butts. In the latter case, the butts are carved in a zoomorphic shape. In historic times such effigy awls were used to pierce the septum of the nose of members of priesthoods, through which an feather was stuck during ceremonies. Other awls were set in a bone or wood handle. Awl sizes varied from 1.5 to 9 inches. There is no particular association of bone awls as grave gifts with gender or age (Hodge 1920; Smith et.al. 1966:244-246,258-259).\r\nThe articular end of 675-2 remains more or less intact and is used as a handle. The point is skillfully crafted. If it blunted through use, it could be re-sharpened and re-used. RMV 675-3 shows that almost the entire surface of the bone was worked, and Hodge regarded this type as the most attractive in appearance. This specimen with its differently shaped ends, one pointed like an awl, the other flattened like a spatula, was apparently for multiple uses, and referred to as awl-spatulas. They might have been used in weaving baskets (Hodge 1920:86, 98-102).\r\n(Hovens and Wilcox 2008-2009)\r\n\r\nHalonawan material culture\r\nIn the decades preceding A.D. 1300 many small settlements in the wider Zuni area were abandoned, and large pueblos emerged in the Ramah-El Morro region, east of present-day Zuni Pueblo. In the 14th century a shift in location took place and new towns emerged on a short stretch on the Zuni River and Ojo Caliente Wash, most of these still occupied in historic times. These included Halonawan North, on the present site of Zuni Pueblo and now virtually completely covered by the modern village, and Halonawan South, just south of the pueblo, across the Zuni River. Cushing' s house at Zuni was built directly on top of the site. Grayware was the most prevalent pottery type excavated at Halonawan South, accounting for almost 50%, followed by St. Johns redwares (17%) and Tularosa black-on-white (8%). The main occupation of this site is dated as from 1275 to 1325 A.D. (Kintigh 1985; Anyon 1992; Huntley and Kintigh 2004; Kintigh et.al. 2004).\r\n(Wilcox and Hovens 2008-09)" .
