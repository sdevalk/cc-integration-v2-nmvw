Morning star poles are used in performance by members of Elcho Island's clan, as well as other Galpu clan members, in ritual burial ceremonies. The feathered string connects the deceased's soul to the Morning Star, to guide it to its resting place.  As well as ceremonial performances and song cycles relating to life and death, birth and rebirth, the Morning Star also refers to the planet Venus. In the Galpu's clan Dreaming story, the Morning Star is believed to belong to an old woman who lives on an island of the dead. Before dawn, she releases the star, tethered by a long piece of feathered string to the island, whence it returns to be kept in a basket until its next rising. \r\n\r\nSusan McCulloch. 1999.
