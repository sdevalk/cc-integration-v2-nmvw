Reverend Samuel Marsden, and resided with him there for several years, like a considerable number of lslanders\r\nof the period. they were keenly interested in visiting Britain; Marsden thought a visit would help build support for the mission.\r\nand their passage was arranged. They arrived in February 1818 on HMB Kangaroo, but coped poorly in the winter and both\r\nsuffered bronchial infections. Among those who kept them company as they recuperated was George Selh Bull. a schoolteacher and\r\nmissionary who had worked with communities of freed slaves in Sierra Leone. This group of arresting drawings was executed for\r\nhim. most likely in the context of extended conversations about Maori custom and culture. Tuai represented the face, or rather the moto, facial tattoo, of his eider brother Korokoro: this and the other illustrations featuring kites, canoes and weapons notably give prominence to the aesthetically charged designs of these forms, as well as the fibre accoutrements on the prow and stern of the canoes, which accentuated the vessels' presence and power. These were, in other words, not so much depictions that conveyed the visual appearance of the subjects as representations of what rendered a Màori face, canoe or ensemble of warriors full of mana. Tuai and Titere met diverse supporters of the mission and provided the Cambridge linguïst Samuel Lee with material towards his study of the Maori language. They retumed to New Zealand in 1820.
