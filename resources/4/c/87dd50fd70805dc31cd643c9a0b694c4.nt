<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1286-9> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "A large number of fragments of objects are known from collections associated with the Kingdom of Benin. Some of these objects may have been broken before 1897 and looted in this fragmentary state. The fact that such objects were also seized in 1897 indicates the extent to which looting took place, extending beyond the largest, most intricate pieces, to virtually anything and everything. Others may have been broken during the military campaign and fire, and some in the years after, as objects moved between museums and owners. Some fragments of the same objects are known in different collections, and it is hoped by placing them together here, more examples might be found.\r\n\r\nEen ivoren onderarm met een gebalde vuist. Op een oud etiket op de arm staat dat de arm is uitgegraven in Benin in 1897." .
