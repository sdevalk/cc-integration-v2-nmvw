In regular intervals, there is one incised dog tooth on the string. Dog teeth were valuable because of their scarcity. The glass beads were introduced by European traders and often replaced traditional shell or coconut beads.\r\nThe necklace is worn by women and men and mostly worn for ceremonies." .
