Queenie spent most of her early life on Texas Downs and used to travel through this country when she was a young woman. Galyirranggin is the flat topped hill at the top of the painting. Near it flows Lajibany (Horshoe Creek) shown as the black line. Lajibany eventually empties into Ord River. In Lajibany country there is a place where a group of Aboriginal people were massacred in the early days by local policemen. The other red ochre motifs show the hills in the surrounding country." .
