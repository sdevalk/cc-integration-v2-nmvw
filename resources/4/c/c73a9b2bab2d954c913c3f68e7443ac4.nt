<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/IB2020-9-1> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Micronesian navigators (paliuw) used spirit images in Janus or back-to-back form representing named guardian spirits such as yaliulewaiy, as charms to protect them from storms. They incorporated stingray spines, said to be vital to their potency, and in this case coconut leaves. Spirits were invoked prior to the voyage with chants; the charm was carried aboard the sailing canoe, protected within a small spirit house. If the weather appeared threatening, the navigator would bring it out and appeal to the spirit to calm the storm. The work in the Linden-Museum was collected by Augustin Kr√§mer from Lamotrek atoll, part of the vast archipelago of the Caroline Islands, which he visited twice in late 1909 and early 1910. The endurance and revival of Lamotrek navigational knowledge and ritual were represented in the 1996 film Spirits of the Voyage. The Paris charm, featuring  a coral 'body'is thought to have been used in a similar way but there is no provenance to link it to a specific island.\r\n\r\n(Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts,p.285)" .
