<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/bf25af9ef1d3c09ab66df970936ef466> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This basket is woven from rattan or other plant stems, which are entwined or woven together with a leaf strip. The long stem is laid in a concentric spiral which is tied together with leaves. It has high a narrow opening at the top and a bulgy middle. The woven basket is coated with a thick, moist mass of Parinarium to make it waterproof and more stable. First, the inner side is coated, then the outer side. The basket is put in the sun to dry, where it gets its dark brown colour. The surface is then smoothened. The basket has a separate foot in the shape of a ring to support it further. This thick ring is made of a large bundle of rattan stems which are braided with a mesh of rattan strips.\r\nBasketry-making was the job of men. \r\nBaskets were used as a bowl for storage or short-distance transport of plant food, especially fruit." .
