It has a rectangular, almost square shape. \r\nWomen manufacture those bags. They start with plaiting the upper rim out of a palm leaf rip, which is split into several parts which are intertwined. The rips are split again into smaller strips, which are plaited into the desired shape of the bag. The two sides are closed on the bottom. Some plaited cords are attached to the top as straps. \r\nThe bags serve to carry smaller goods such as betel nuts and to store sago flour and taro roots. Some use it to carry food for a journey, such as fish and sago." .
