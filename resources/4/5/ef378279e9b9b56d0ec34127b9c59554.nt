Woo Jinâ€™s ongoing series, Dokkaebi, are creatures from Korean mythology and folklore, which are told to have formed from a spiritual possession of an inanimate object. Through the creation of her own modern-day Dokkaebi, Woo Jin uses this being as a vessel and mischievous spokesperson for her imagined new world. Dokkaebi suggests an alternative way of moving through the material world that eschews our current capitalist obsession with disposability for a more mystical and enchanting frame of view." .
