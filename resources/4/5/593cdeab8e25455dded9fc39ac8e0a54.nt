A stick of soft wood, in this case a dry saguaro (Cereus giganteus) rib, was pinned down by sitting upon with the knees spread, and is referred to as \"hearth\" by anthropologists. A stick of hardwood was put on it vertically and set into a rapid motion between the moving palms of the hands. The friction thus engendered in the socket first produced heat, and subsequently a red hot glow which set the wood dust on fire. This in turn kindled dry fibers and twigs, thus enabling to build a fire for cooking and warmth. The kitchen hearth was situated in a brush enclosure and usually consisted of three stones on which earthen pots were placed for cooking. In Pima villages fire was often preserved in an old tree stump, kept smoldering and ready to use. The Pimas considered the sun as the source of fire, but according to tribal tradition they had learned the art of fire making from Blue Fly (Russell 1908:69,102,216; Beals 1934:18).\r\n(Hovens 2009)\r\n\r\nSahuaro-hout om vuur te maken. \"Eweta Koet\"(ser. etiket)." .
