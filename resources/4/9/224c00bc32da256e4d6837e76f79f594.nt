Traditionally they were made in the image of person and then sung to, either to give the person health and life, or death.Medicine dolls are held in enormous dread as they activate the supernatural powers from the Dreamtime which cannot be controlled by man. Carved from or swamp Eucalyptus, it is painted in traditional body paint designs, human hair has also been used on the dolls head. The doll was collected in north-east Arnhem Land and the sculptors name i9s unknown.\r\n\r\nSculpture\r\n\r\nBefore the arrival of European settlers in Australia, all Aboriginal three-dimensional sculptures were ephermeral, designed through inspiration from the Dreaming or tjurkurpa and translated into reality for a brief moment of ceremony. Unlike many African nations, for example, Australia had no tradition of venerating ancestors through carved wooden or moulded images. Ritual objects in Australia were either designed to influence the spiritual powers by allowing their life force to enter the temporal world during dance and ritual, or to encourage the spirits of the dead to leave the temporal world and pass into the landscape whence they came. \r\nFor the purpose of bringing the life force of ancestral beings into ceremonies, fibre representations of snakes, birds and animals were made , both in symbolic shapes and realistic representations. After use in ceremonial dances and rituals, these were then destroyed or discarded. To encourage the departure of the spirit to the ancestral home of the spirit. Tiwi mortuary practices included making sculpted wooden grave poles and, in Arnhem Land, hollow bark and wood bone containers were painted with special designs. These also were left to desintegrate over time; no attempt was made to restore or to repaint them.\r\nSome facets of Aboriginal creative life were, however, designed to last.\r\nAncient stone formations found in many arid zones were thought to be the work of spirits themselves and at the time of European contact were only repaired by living people. Sacred stone discs or carved anddecorated tjuringa were also thought by desert peoples to be the  core of power of a particular ancestor and were kept hidden for hidden generations, Produced only for secret men's ceremonies. The ancient carvings on treesthat marked burial and initiation sites in New South Wales and south-eastern Queensland lasted for the life of the tree.\r\nThe pattern and constructions made on the ground for ceremonies in central Australia discussed in the chapter on Papunya painting, as well as low moulded and mounted earth constructions made in the south-east for bora initiation ceremonies, could also accurately be termed sculptures, but, like others forms of Aboriginal sacred arts, these were not shown publicly at the time of their creation, and they may not be seen publicly now. The bora mounds have largerly disappeared, with only a few overgrown hillocks now protected from destruction.\r\nThe complex dancing headdresses and constructions carried on the shoulders in Western Australia, Central Australia and South Australia should also by rights be included in the spectrum of Aboriginal sculpture, and these are also considered sacred and private objects. In Cape York wooden sculptures were made to represent animals and fish in dances commemorating mythological events. These and unique elaborate dancing masks set apart the sculptural arts of the Aboriginals Cape York, linking the visual arts strongly with those of the Torres Straits and Papua New Guinea." .
