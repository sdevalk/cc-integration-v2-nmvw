He answered, \"Yes, mistress!\" She\r\n       said,\"If this slave-girl of mine comes to you, visit us with\r\n       him, in order that we may entertain you and entertain him at\r\n       home, so that he may not blame us and say that there are no\r\n       generous people in Baghdad. For avarice is the worst defect\r\n       in mankind. Did you hear what I said to you? If you fail to\r\n       come, you will incur my anger, and I will never greet you\r\n       again.\"\r\n2)   [T] Arches France &\r\n3)   [B] Arabisch schrift &\r\n4)   [T] This is number five - The artist did not number it" .
