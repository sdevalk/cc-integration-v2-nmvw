Religieuze volksschildering voorstellend twee staande onsterfelijken. De staande figuur steunend op een kruk is Li Tieguai (Kor.: Yi Sugwae), met een kalebas in zijn handen. De andere onsterfelijke, te herkennen aan zijn fluit, is Zhang Guolao (Kor: Chang Kwa-no). Deze fluit is de yuku, uit bamboe vervaardigd en die ook als wandelstok fungeert.\r\nOp de achterkant van het papier staat in een hoek met inkt het Chinese karakter voor '2'.\r\n\r\nIn this painting, two immortals are depicted; Tieguai Li (Yi Sugwae in Korean pronunciation)  the cripple who holds a crutch and a gourd, and Zhang Guolao (Chang Kwa-no in Korean pronunciation) who has the yuku, bamboo cane in his hands. Zhang Guolao was said to have lived between the 7th and 8th centuries and had the power to render himself invisible. His yuku was believed to be a musical wind instrument.  \r\nTieguai Li is represented as a beggar on a crutch. He was adept at leaving his body and roaming the countryside. It was during one of these episodes that one of his disciples, believing him really dead, buried him. When the disembodied spirit returned to find no body into which he could enter, he hastily looked and entered the dead body of a lame beggar. His emblem is the pilgrim's gourd.\r\nWhen Korea entered the Chos≈èn Dynasty, its ambassadors were sent to China to learn Daoist Fasts and Offerings rituals. Cheng Emperor of the Ming Dynasty sent persons specially assigned for taking 600 kinds of Daoist moral tracts to Korea. Because a Daoist organization was not formed in Korea, it vanished into folk beliefs or other religious beliefs (Heavenly Daoism). \r\nDaoist (Taoist) immortals are considered 'patron saints' of the Daoist belief. Their images were representative of typical individuals and represented wealth and poverty, old age, and youth, male and female. It was believed that ordinary human beings could learn the sectets of nature and become immortal, through hard study. These immortals were idolised and respected for their wisdom, humour, and moral lessons. Normally, only eight immortals are officially recognised, but legends describe several more. As the Eight Daoist Immortals to which they belong, these emblems are representations of longevity." .
