Aan de ene kant een lus, aan de andere kant afgesneden. Aan een van de zijden over het grootste deel met nassaschelpplaatjes bekleed.\r\nDoor Herr Witte ter plaatse verameld in zomer 1953.\r\n\r\nWaist belts which are worn much lower down are often used by the women to attach the bark petticoat and also by the men to fasten the apron. They are pushed down below the navel. Proper ornamental belts are worn round the smallest part of the body, between the curvature of the lower ribs and the iliac crests\r\nSande supposed that the belt were made by the women because women sold them to him. \r\nThey are plaited in a horizontal herring-bone design (See Sande, 1907, 88, fig. 53)\r\nBlack mycelium could be fastened between the superficial stitches in Abar (1528-262 and 1528-263) and Puyo (1528-264) whereas in Tobadi a male belt was decorated outside with white (lime) figures.\r\nWhen women of the adjacent Lake Sentani left their village to go to the Humboldt Bay with their husband, they took off their former belts to adopt the one worn in Humboldt Bay. The latter were made from shining red brown strips of sago palm leaf with fine strings ornamented with coix seeds and a plaited fringe." .
