<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/8554fbebfdad97cb145e9d735d35f54d> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Wooden paddles were used to power small outrigger canoes within the sheltered waters of the extensive lagoons that fringed the Reef Islands and the Santa Cruz Islands ( Temotu province, Solomon Islands). They were also taken aboard sailing vessels known as tepukei on inter-island journeys. Made of light woodm these essential implements were decorated with elegant angular motifs recalling the wings of frigate birds or the fins of fish.\r\nSince the Spanish first vistited the Temotu province in the 16th century, the islands there were tainted with reports of hostility and cannibalism. For that reasonm although some expoloring and trading vessels did visit the islandsm many encounters occurred at sea, not on landm and much of the trade and exchange included artefacts often to be found aboard canoesm such as fishing gear and paddles.\r\n\r\n(Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts, p.284)" .
