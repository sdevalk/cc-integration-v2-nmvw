<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/WM-67331> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This hat represents an imitation of the Uyghur doppa. Doppa (literally ‘hat’ in Uzbek) is a round or square skullcap originating in the Caucasus and worn by Kazan Tatars, Tajiks and Uzbeks. In China it is worn by Uyghurs, who live primarily in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. They are one of China’s fifty-five officially-recognized ethnic minorities. The Uyghur doppa comes in many colours and patterns. This piece is probably an imitation, because it is not made strictly within the traditional model of doppa, but the decorations are clearly using the idea of it. These hats fit into a category of toys that were produced from the 1950s, deployed for ideo-political education aimed at teaching children about different ethnic groups in China (also see dolls WM-56741 to WM-56752). \r\n\r\nHannah Li, April 2019" .
