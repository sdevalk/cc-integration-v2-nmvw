On both sides of the notch, there are four tiny holes into which fibre strings with beads can be put. The whole stick has fine carvings all over which are coloured black. It shows symmetrical patterns with triangles. \r\nBoth men and women have a penetrated nasal septum from quite early onwards, but only seldom do they wear nose adornments." .
