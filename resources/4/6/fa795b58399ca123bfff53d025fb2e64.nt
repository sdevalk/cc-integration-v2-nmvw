Originally used for this purpose they eventually became more heavily decorated with silver and worn more as a decorative element. Today men wear ketohs during ceremonial dances and to express strength and intent.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Diné are best known as semi-nomadic pastoralists and agriculturalists the hunting of animals to supplement the diet was more common in the past than it is today. Hunting was and continues to be a male dominated activity, regaled with expressed and unexpressed ritual and ceremony (Downs 1972:82). According to Rogers: “[A] certain amount of luck is involved which can be improved by observing ritual and taboo.” One ritual for hunting deer is the Stalking Way in which the hunter dressed in deerskin clothing made from the hide of an unwounded animal. Hides without piercings retain the spirit of the animal and are considered to be sacred. Successful hunters are said to adopt the mannerisms of the deer during the hunt (Rogers 2001:28,46).\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain sacred buckskin for ceremonies a single hunter in excellent physical condition or a relay of hunters run down a deer until it is exhausted. The hunter smothers the deer by placing corn pollen in the nose and mouth. Vitally, this prevents the deer’s breath from escaping and its life force thus remains in the body. The hides obtained in this manner are tanned and used for masks and other ritual items (Rogers 2001:46). It is also customary to save the deer’s antlers. These are ritually blessed and used in various ceremonies. They are also ground up and sprinkled on hot coals as incense or as a fumigant (Newcomb 1956:33). Tanned skins and meat were also traded to the Pueblos and Spaniards along the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nSymbols of hunted animals are depicted in sand paintings. Sand paintings which are made for hunters carry symbols of all the game animals. According to Newcomb (1956:33), “The bodies, legs, and hooves of the deer, antelope, elk, and mountain goat are all made the same, the body being a long rectangle with rounded corners, the slim legs bending inwards ending in split hooves. The deer’s head is carried high, with fairly long ears and spreading antlers…”\r\n\r\nThe deer outlined in brass tacks on this ketoh fits Newcomb’s description for sand paintings but it also resembles the images of deer found in rock art sites. Rogers (2001:43) found that “[t]he animals hunted, the technical aspects of hunting, the ritual of hunting, and the hunters themselves are represented in Dinétah [the Gobernador-Largo region of northwestern New Mexico] rock art.” Polly Schaafsma (1980:322) suggests that the Navajo hunting scene panels that are re-pecked and incorporated into the earlier Rosa petroglyph sites in the Largo Canyon drainage in New Mexico “may have been a means by which the Navajo capitalized on the power or hunting magic of their predecessors, bringing it into their own realm of use.” Rogers (2001:48) adds: “the act was symbolic and not representational. The Navajo hunter drew his symbols because he wished to be successful…”\r\n\r\nDine ketohs were decorated with silver as early as the 1870s (Tisdale 2006:106). Collected by Ten Kate in 1883 on the Navajo Reservation this particular ketoh is unusual and may possibly represent a transition from what was originally a piece of leather strapped to the wrist. On the other hand as Mera (1960:50) observed, “brass and copper were sometimes resorted to,” when silver was either scarce or unobtainable.” Given the early age and because the maker is unknown and the imagery is significant we can surmise that possibly this ketoh was possibly used for deer hunting and had both a practical and magical purpose.\r\n\r\nShelby Tisdale\r\nThe Autry Museum, Los Angeles, CA; 2015\r\n\r\nJames F.

Early specimens made from bark and hide might have been reinforced with stone or shell. When bows and arrows were replaced by firearms, wrist guards increasingly became a fashion accessory (Ostermann 1917:9; Lincoln 1982:141). Especially after 1880 they were decorated with panels of wrought and cast silver showing a variety of designs, and metal buttons, sometimes brass, often silver. Turquoise was frequently added and sometimes other stones (Woodward 1938:40-41; Adair 1944:34-35; Mera 1960:50-63; Kluckhohn et.al. 1971:51-53; Bedinger 1973:53-56; Ellsberg 1977; Jernigan 1981: 41-42; Tisdale 2006:106-107).\r\nThis specimen is made of harness leather and shows a design executed in tiny brass tacks, representing a male deer, sinking through its hind legs after being shot. Whether this depiction is simply representational or was considered magical, empowering the hunter on his chase, is not known. In any case, such a pictorial representation on an early wrist guard is extremely rare. A similar design of a deer is documented on an early tobacco case, made in the shape of an army canteen (Matthews 1883:plate 16; cf. Frank and Holbrook 1990:53,60,70-1,89-90,102,126,135,153-5,171-2; Fane 1991:79).\r\nPieter Hovens, 2008-2009\r\n\r\n\r\nNavajos gebruikten pijl en boog bij de jacht en oorlogvoering. Om hun pols tegen letsel door de terugspringende pees te beschermen, werden polsbeschermers gemaakt in de vorm van een dikke leren manchet. Deze werden later versierd met patronen van koper, tin en zilver dat door de handel met blanken werd verkregen. Soms zijn de versieringen abstract, soms naturalistisch, zoals op deze polsbeschermer: een aangeschoten hert. De motieven zijn soms uitgevoerd in de vorm van spijkertjes of pinnetjes, soms in de vorm van metalen plaatjes. Toen pijl en boog in onbruik raakten, werden polsbeschermers tot accessoires ter sier. Zelfs werden polsbeschermers met grote zilveren platen of geheel van zilver gemaakt, bezet met turkoois en andere kleurige stenen, en voorzien van gestanste florale en abstracte motieven. Kenmerkend is ook een centrale gekleurde steen op een zilveren plaat. Oude polsbeschermers zijn waardevol bezit en worden gedragen bij dansen en ceremonies. Heden ten dage worden ze nog zo nu en dan gemaakt voor verzamelaars en toeristen." .
