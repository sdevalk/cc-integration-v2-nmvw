The image refers to the Inuit-spiritual culture. Places on the landscape are still today said to be inhabited by spirit and other supernatural beings. Sometimes sounds can be heard and the explanation is “kivitoq”(spirits). Some of these places are feared and only encounters with spirits one is familiar with are save and appreciated. In the collection of the NMVW, images of the landscape are rare, as well as depictions of spirits in the landscape. This is a very welcome addition to our collection. The composition of many faces in a stone carving goes back to historical times in pre-Inuit Dorset culture, also absent in the collection except for a Lucy Tasseur  sculpture (RV-6094-85).\r\nThe Torngat Mountains National Park is situated north of the Labrador Inuit settlement area. The Torngat Mountains National Park Reserve was formally established when the legislation giving effect to the Labrador Inuit Land Claims Agreement was enacted on December 1, 2005. The national park reserve became the Torngat Mountains National Park when the Nunavik Inuit Land Claims Agreement came into legal effect on July 10, 2008. The area is a national reserve and ancient Inuit hunting and fishing land.
