But the exposure of her genitals was also said to frighten away harmful spirits, thus rendering her a protective goddess; while a further interpretation suggedsts that the sculptures alluded to the presence of mongol, women who would travel to a village distant from their own to obtain wealth by engaging in a form of customary prostitution. This seeming confusion points to the way Islanders with varying perspectives, as men or women, young people or eldersm and those with differing moral viewsm could offer quite different explanations of an art form that without doubt dramatised sexuality and fecundity, as well as moments of revelation and shame.\r\n\r\n(Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts p.294)" .
