<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/33dddae42a4cbc7cab7f07180d10308d> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This poster depicts Gau Mata, or 'Cow Mother' as a divine being. This image of the cow as a holy figure emerges after 1892, when Saraswati Dayananda (founder of the Arya Samaj Hindu reform movement) forms the Gaurakshini Sabha (Cow protecting Association), that was dedicated to protecting the cow from any sort of slaughter or killing, and petitioned the colonial government to ban the slaughter of cows. This movement is part of Indian nationalist sentiment in North India (beginning in urban areas in the Punjab and then extending to rural areas in Eastern Bihar).  Cow protection mobilised the idea that the cow is sacred within an upper-caste, Hindu worldview, and targeted Muslims, Christians and lower-caste Hindus who consumed beef or worked in industries such as butchery, tannery, etc., that would involve the slaughter of cattle. The cow protection movement is therefore associated with what is known as 'communal' (religious) identity. Cow protection, and the symbol of gau mata, was considered to be a symbol of an independent Indian nation, but one that is high-caste Hindu in its worldview and cultural/social/religious habits.\r\nThe cow was mobilised as a sacred Hindu symbol that was a microcosm of the nation and the cosmos itself. Therefore we see in this image that various gods, goddesses, and holy figures reside within the body of the cow. At the top of this image, we see Brahma, the creator (left), Vishnu, the maintainer of the universal order (middle) and Shiva, the destroyer of cycles of the universe (right).  \r\nMuch like the chromolithograph prints on which this poster is based, the pastoral setting mimics European landscapes--here we see mountains and lakes in the background." .
