A walk through Johannesburg's cemeteries offers a visual history of premature loss through mine related explosions. The granite memorial in the Braamfontein Cemetery erected in memory of those who lost their lives in the great dynamite explosion of 1896, is still moving and offers a unique insight into Johannesburg history. \r\nThe memorial takes us back to one of the earliest and most tragic mining disasters in the city's history. On 19th February 1896, a freight train left stationary on a siding at the then Johannesburg Railway Station (it was in Braamfontein and today is known as the Braamfontein Station) carrying dynamite exploded. The train comprised of eight trucks of dynamite (Norwich says ten) or 2300 wooden cases adding up to between 56 and 60 tons of dynamite (AP Cartwright gives the statistics of 3000 cases of blasting gelatine amounting to 80 tons). The trucks had been left standing in the sun for three and a half days (why is a crucial question) and, when a shunting engine was backed into these trucks, the impact apparently caused the dynamite to explode in the hot afternoon sun (is this the only plausible explanation?).\r\nThe explosion blew a crater measuring 250 feet long by 60 feet wide and about 50 feet deep (see main image). The estimates of the number of people killed vary from 75 to 130 with over 300 people injured. The Obelisk records 75 dead while The Star reported 78 fatalities and four boxes of remains. The exact number of casualties will never be known. It is also estimated that between 1500 and 3000 homes were destroyed. I find it fascinating that different sources quote different statistics for deaths, injuries, losses of homes, size of the crater and so on.\r\nIn early 1896 Johannesburg was a young mining town emerging from mining camp status. While newer permanent businesses, office blocks, retail shops, clubs and hotels were being built in downtown Johannesburg, and the newly acquired wealth showed in bricks, mortar and ornamental masonry and iron work, many of the homes of ordinary workers were very temporary, speedily erected, almost jerry built structures. They were made of wooden timbers and corrugated iron, perhaps some rough locally made baked clay brick walls. Many were no more than cottages or shacks. \r\nThe houses in and around the station, in Braamfontein and the surrounding suburbs took the brunt of the explosion. It was reported that every window in the centre of Johannesburg was blown out. Chimneys ended like forlorn relics sticking out from the soil. The iron rail tracks were pushed up and suspended at crazy angles. Railway locomotives were derailed or destroyed. Hedley Chilvers describes “a vast black and gold cloud rising like a colossal mushroom into the blue.” Debris then fell to earth, a mix of body parts, horse remains, earth and iron fragments. Injuries were caused not only by the explosion but by the subsequent disintegration and collapse of masonry, timber and iron sheets. People of all races were killed and most deaths were women and children. Many were poor people from the nearby suburbs of Newtown and Fordsburg, the locations of Brickfields (one can position the locations on the 1896 map) and Braamfontein itself. The horse and animal carnage must also have been immense. The impact of the explosion was felt miles away and the sound of the explosion heard some 10 to 200kms away (again a vague range).\r\nThe time of the day was unfortunate, as in the mid afternoon while the menfolk were at work, the women and children were at home and hence casualties were unusually heavy among the families. Limbs were dismembered and bodies were unrecognizable such was the impact. Rescuers wept as they gathered up the bodies of young children. Nothing remained of the loading clerk Dirk of Doornfontein, tasked with the job of offloading the trucks.\r\nKathy Munro (26-02-2016)\r\nhttp://www.theheritageportal.co.za/article/unanswered-questions-120-years-after-great-braamfontein-dynamite-explosion" .
