A large part of the surface is decorated with a carved ornamentation painted in red, white and black. On several places the object is further decorated with bunches of white feathers.\r\nThe object was collected by Father J. Verschueren during a ritual celebration in Wajaw (Kumbe-river) in November 1957. It was made in an old style and used in a performance, sapra, on the occasion of a cult celebration. This fish-like head ornament was carried on the head during the ritual re-enactment of the myth. \r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 28.11. 2006" .
