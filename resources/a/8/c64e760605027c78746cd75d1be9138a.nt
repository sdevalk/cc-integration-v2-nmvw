At night, namarnday emerge to leap, run and gambol about.\r\n\r\n\"The old people\" (past generations) often saw these spirits, and later painted their likeness either on rock faces or on the interior walls of their bark huts.\r\n\r\nThe artist has here shown five namarnday making love in a group.\r\n\r\nThis piece was painted for Lance Bennett during one of his visits to the small Aboriginal community on Mudginberri cattle station, between the South and East Alligator Rivers, in the Dry season of 1966.\r\n\r\ncopyright Lance Bennett" .
