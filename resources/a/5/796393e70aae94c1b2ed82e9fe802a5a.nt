<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/c4e11320d729f4fef9451c2e5e6190ea> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This dowry chest, or muqaddama in Arabic, accompanied the bride to her new household and was filled with goods such as linens, clothes, or jewellery, which would help her begin her new life as a married woman. This chest is flat on top because it also served as a bench to sit on in the home. Its red colour is a symbol of celebration, fertility, and blood, and is typical of dowry chests from the Middle East and North Africa. These chests were often decorated with protective and good luck symbols. Here two lions, Muslim symbols related to Ali, the son-in-law of the prophet Muhammad, protect the chest. The chest is also decorated with religious expressions in Arabic. The inscription in the central medallion says 'Congratulations to you, oh bride!'" .
