Twee stuks van verschillende grootte.\r\n\r\nKorean brushes have been made with a wide variety of different animal hairs over time, ranging from the fleece of sheep, horse, raccoon and dog hair, the tail hairs of weasels and squirrels, hairs from the back of cats, the underarm hair of roe deer, the tail feathers of birds, and the whiskers of mice. \r\nBrushes are also categorized according to use and size. Those used for calligraphy or design were divided into a number of distinct categories according to the length and breadth of the bristles: e.g. large, medium and small tips. The so-called \"signboard brush\" (aekjip'il) was relatively large and normally used for signboards or calligraphy. The bristles on juryonp'il brushes used to write the couplets mounted on boards hung from the pillars of a house, were longer than 6cm and generally used for calligraphy. The bristles on brushes used to paint \"The Four Gentlemen\" (bamboo, plum, orchid and chrysanthemum), symbols of the ideal attributes of a noble man, were longer and finer than juryonp'il and, as a result, were softer and more flexible." .
