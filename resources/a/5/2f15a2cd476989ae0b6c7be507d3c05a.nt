There was only a small number of clouds in the sky and the light from the stars brightened the night.\r\nThe curvey lines represented small and long groups of stars. The long and shortlines represent the other stars in space.\r\nThe dreaming took place in Kulungalinpa near the Duck Pond area of the Northern Territory." .
