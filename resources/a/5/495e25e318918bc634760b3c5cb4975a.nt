Kuan Ti is not only a natural favourite of soldiers but has been chosen patron of numerous trades and professions. Peddlers of bean curd, for example, take him as their own, for Kuan Yü is said to have supported himself in like manner early in life.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü lived during the chivalrous era of the Three Kingdoms (3rd century AD) and has been romanticized in popular lore, in drama, and especially in the Ming dynasty novel San Kuo yen-i, as a sort of Chinese Robin Hood. When a magistrate was about to carry off a young girl, Kuan Yü came to her rescue and killed the man. Kuan Yü, fleeing for his life, came upon a guarded barrier. Suddenly his face changed to a reddish hue, and Kuan was able to pass unrecognized.\r\n\r\nOne of China's best known stories tells how he became one of the Three Brothers of the Peach Orchard. Liu Pei, a maker of straw sandals, intervened in a fight that was brewing between Kuan Yü and a prosperous butcher named Chang Fei. The three became friends and swore oaths of undying loyalty that they faithfully observed until death.\r\n\r\nKuan Yü was captured and executed in AD 219, but his fame continued to grow as rulers conferred successively greater titles upon him. Finally, in 1594, a Ming dynasty emperor canonized him as god of war--protector of China and of all its citizens. Thousands upon thousands of temples were constructed, each bearing the title Wu Miao (Warrior Temple) or Wu Sheng Miao (Sacred Warrior Temple). Many were built at government expense so that prescribed sacrifices could be offered on the 15th day of the second moon and on the 13th day of the fifth moon.\r\n\r\nFor a time the sword of the public executioner was housed in Kuan Ti's temple. After a criminal was put to death, the magistrate in charge of executions worshiped in the temple, certain that the spirit of the dead man would not dare to enter the temple or even follow the magistrate home.\r\n\r\nIn art Kuan Ti usually wears a green robe and has a reddish face. Almost always he is accompanied by his squire and his son. Other representations show Kuan Ti holding one of the Confucian classics, the Tso Chuan, which he reputedly memorized. This feat of memory led the literati to adopt him as the god of literature, a post he now shares with another deity, Wen Ti.\r\n\r\nIn the 17th century Kuan Ti's cult spread to Korea, where it was popularly believed that he saved the country from invasion by the Japanese." .
