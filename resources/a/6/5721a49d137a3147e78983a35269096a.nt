<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/5f87c7548285662aebf2ce3efd71cb3f> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The ladle is made of half a coconut shell and a wooden ladle. The hollowed out and smoothed coconut is parted in half (not necessarily evenly). A carved wooden ladle of different size and adornment is glued to the coconut. It is always attached in the inside. The manufacture was the work of the men, as is almost all carving  and wood work. \r\nDifferent kinds of adornments can be identified. They most probable don't have a special meaning, but are expression of the artist's creativity. The handle is long and quadrangular. It is glued to the inside of the coconut with Parinarium. The upper end shows an oval flat disk. Just above the rim of the coconut is a carved-out cube. The middle part in between is slightly bulgy. The whole handle has carvings all around, which are painted white and red. \r\nThe ladle was used to scoop liquids and solid food from pots and kettles, often from a big wooden bowl. This was often done on feasts, to give out soup to guests. The ladles were kept in the house of the men and were sometimes a present to guests." .
