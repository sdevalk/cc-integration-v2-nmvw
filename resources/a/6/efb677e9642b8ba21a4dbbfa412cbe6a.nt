<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/844e27aff13dd5988e66bc25237bfd31> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Second diplomatic journey to Yemen in 1942.\r\n\r\nWar threatened Europe dragging along the greater part of the world. Daniel van der Meulen was appointed again as a diplomat in the harbour city of Jeddah to look after the Netherlands East Indies Mecca pilgrims who got stuck there. He could arrange their return but there was more to be done on the diplomatic field in this part of the world. Several diplomatic journeys were made in wartime with talks, negotiations and  inspections. Two of these journeys brought him again in Sana'a in Yemen and in the Hadhramaut.\r\n\r\nAs was the case in 1931 Imam Yaya of Sana'a had big problems with its British southern neighbours in the Protectorate of Aden and their Arabic inhabitants. Now in wartime the British had the feeling that the Imam was more directed to the German and  Italian side of the world conflict. Specially after broadcastings of the German radio of the suggestion and possibilities attacking the British Protectorate of Aden by the Imam of Yemen the British became worried and wanted to do something to alter the Imam's mind. However they could do little because British diplomats were refused to enter the Imam's country. As the Imam said to the British representatives: 'we are a neutral country and want to stay as such; none of the parties at war will be allowed to enter my country as long as the war lasts'.  So the British Government in London asked the Dutch Government in exile if they could send a man to Sana'a to change the 'supposed' German feelings of the Imam. Because Daniel van der Meulen had met Imam Yaya before with friendly talks about Dutch diplomatic relationships he was supposed to be the right man. However Van der Meulen suggested that he would go to the Imam as a private person without escort just as an old friend. Two cars were delivered him by the British and Americans in Jeddah to do the journey along the coast south to al-Hudaydah and from there inland across the mountains to Sana'a. The drivers of the cars were people from Java and with them travelled the Javanese doctor Idris, all members of the Dutch legation in Jeddah. To the borders of Saudi Arabia and Yemen the travels were under the protection by  Saudis soldiers. They had big problems with the cars which were not suitable for the rough terrains. In Yemen however the authorities received them inquisitive but friendly. In Sana'a he met his old friend the Secretary of Foreign Affairs Qadi Raghib again. The meeting was heartily as friends but as a government representative the Secretary was more reserved. In the many conversations Van der Meulen could feel the pro German side of Yemen's point of view although they said to be neutral. At last Qadi Raghib could arrange a meeting with the Imam in his summer palace outside Sana'a. The meeting went well and the Imam assured Van der Meulen the neutral position of Yemen towards the war parties. In the later conversations with the Foreign Secretary Van der Meulen could convince him to listen more to the B.B.C. radio about the war situations and trust them in stead of the war messages of the German radio. During the weeks of his stay in Sana'a Van der Meulen was free to travel around on horseback. He met many old friends from his earlier visit and made new acquaintances as the British doctor Dr. Petrie who was working on malaria and leprosy in a small but full hospital for the poor in Sana'a. He also met many Jewish people in the Jewish quarter of San'a  and specially the family of Soebeiri of which he could make many photographs. \r\nWith the repaired motorcar the party returned to the coast and from there northwards to reach Jeddah only after many car problems. From Jeddah Daniel van der Meulen could inform  the world about his diplomatic progress in Yemen." .
