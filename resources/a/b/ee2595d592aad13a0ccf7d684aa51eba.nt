<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/5ba1df2aff8c84d46b5f26c669fa9154> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "From; More Whiteman's Kitsch.\r\n\r\nBrook Andrew's work subverts stereotypical notions of Aboriginality in a positive way: it looks to the future and involves a so-called 'alternative' view of Australian history (that of Indigenous Australians).\r\n \r\nSince colonisation, images of Aboriginal people have tended to originate in the dominant culture of 'white Australia'. Aboriginal artists and 'cultural activists' often strive for self-representation in the arts in order to replace those negative, stereotypical images with ones created by Aboriginal people, from the 'inside out'. Brook maintains that this art practice is primarly part of this process of self-representation, directed at both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal audiences; ' My work has always been in an interdisciplinary style, politically and socially provoking. It mainly deals with the subverting of any institutionalised ways of thinking, representation and labelling of Aboriginality, people and culture.\r\n\r\nAndrew notes that there are 'many Kooris out there representing themselves in all fields'. However, the media and academia often bypass their achievements to perpetuate negative and/or 'ethnographic' images. Andrew's work confronts and contradicts neo-colonist and ethnocentric ideologies surrounding Aboriginal culture - ideologies that often materialise as kitsch.\r\n\r\nAndrew uses materials and images that most people can identify and relate to; his work enters the  safe (suburban) haven of the kitchen, the hearth of the home. Indeed, when coupled with a potent undertone, the familiarity of these domestic objects has the ability to shock. In Andrew's 'advertisement' for \"Australian Perspecta 1995 \", the audience are invited to call 'Gwange Cook' on a number which emerges  as Invasion Day, 1788. The work comments further on today's consumerism that encompasses and devours every feature of our lives - not only goods, but also images, concepts and people.\r\n\r\nAndrew's university education has enabled him to explore and experiment with new technologies and media - photography, computer technology, screenprinting and sculpture all contribute to his interdisciplinary style. Specific projects may take advantage of a particular method while others might juxtapose contrasting media. When he includes text in the work he plays on mainstream expectations that a mystical story must accompany 'authentic' Aboriginal work. He cites the focused spatial composition and 'clean lines'  of eminent artists Rover Thomas and Fred Williams as influential in his work. Andrew says his work reflects his connections as a Koori with the local community, and as an Aboriginal person with all Aboriginal people: 'Aboriginal art is a powerful movement that promotes self-representation and affirms the survival of Aboriginal nations all over Australia.'\r\n\r\nMore (please link to www.brookandrew.com)" .
