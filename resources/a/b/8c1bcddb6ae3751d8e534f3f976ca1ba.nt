Fourmile Polychrome was a White Mountain Red Ware made north of the Mogollon Rim in the fourteenth century. Bowls and jars were common, but also several animal effigy jars have been excavated. The focus of decoration is on the interior center, and asymmetric treatment is quite common. Designs include stylized macaws and other birds, butterflies, flowers, and masked faces, and an association with a Southwestern regional cult focussed on weather control and fertility has been suggested. The large-diameter bowls are thought today to have been used in supra-household feasting, its bold exterior designs communicating information about identity to the participants. Fourmile Polychrome is the climax of technostylistic development of White Mountain Redware (Carlson 1970:65-73,116; 1982:218-221; Crown 1994; Mills 2007)." .
