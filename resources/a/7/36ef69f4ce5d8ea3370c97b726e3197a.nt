The whole artefact bears finely incised tooling marks. A label in ink on the specimen reads 'Barrook Djumbi'. In a letter to the museum dated October 1892 Miss Bundock notes 'One broad boomerang - native name \"boorook\" ' [though compare this with the information in the accession registers of The Australian Museum, Sydney for the two ground-edge axes]\r\n\r\néén kant hol [concaaf], de ander bol [convex] (bron: beschrijvingskaart)\r\n\r\nBroad boomerang collected by Mary Bundock during the 1860s. The pastoralist recorded its Aboriginal name as barrook djumbi. All Mary Bundock’s boomerangs were used for fighting and were thrown straight. She wrote: ‘I have not been\r\nable to get one of those that come round in a circle to the thrower’." .
