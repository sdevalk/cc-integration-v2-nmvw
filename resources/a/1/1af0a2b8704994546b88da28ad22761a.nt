A stone, probably of volcanic origin, is hafted in a T-shaped handle. Adzes were used for felling trees and carving out the rough shape of canoes.  Bruni d’Entrecasteaux commented in April 1794 that the Tongans got all their stones for making tools and cutting implements from Fiji as part of an exchange relationship between the archipelagos. However, he admitted to not knowing what the Tongans gave in return.  \r\nThe only two objects from New Caledonia included in the Buyskes collection were ‘adze(s) with stone blades’ (Figure 1a).  One was exchanged with E.H. Giglioli in Florence but no photograph or drawing exists.  Giglioli, a widely published zoologist, specialised in ornithology and ichthyology but developed a keen interest in anthropology and archaeology. In order to carry out a comparative study on Stone Age material culture, he assembled a varied collection of stone implements of which this adze was probably an instance.  Although the so-called ‘knee adze’ was first observed and described during Cook’s second voyage of 1772–5,  the anthropologist Roger Boulay suggested that the Leiden adze (RV-34-10) could very well be the oldest of its type. The tool is shaped in such a way that the carver could easily unlash the blade to sharpen it and then remount it. It is possible that these types of adze could hold a ceremonial blade." .
