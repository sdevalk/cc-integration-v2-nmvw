<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7276-2> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "One of three serigraphs that are part of a series of seven works entitled Tewa Tales of Suspense produced by Jason Garcia-Okuu Pin (Turtle Mountain) from Santa Clara Pueblo to reckon with the Pueblo Revolt of 10 August 1680.\r\nThe Pueblo Revolt is one of the most important Indigenous uprisings in North American history, and the most notable in the Southwest. It followed the establishment of the punitive military and missionary colonisation of the Southwest by the Spanish from the late 16th century which involved both corporeal punishment, violence, and extractive taxation, as well as conversion. The Pueblo Revolt was co-ordinated by the Rio Grande Pueblos and led by Poâ€™Pay from Okhay Owingeh. This resulted in reciprocal violence and the expulsion of the Spanish conquistadors and missionaries from what is now New Mexico for 12 years before the re-conquest that began in 1692 and was finalised in 1696.\r\nThe prints are hand pulled, ten colour serigraph (silk screen prints) and produced in an edition of 20. Tewa Tales of Suspense is also a series of works on ceramics by Garcia in the same graphic style." .
