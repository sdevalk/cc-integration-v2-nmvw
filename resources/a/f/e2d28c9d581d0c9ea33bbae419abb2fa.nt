<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/IB2020-9-3> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The last decades of the nineteenth century were marked by an intensification of colonial engagement in island Melanesia. British and German traders and planters actively aimed to take control of land, recruited workers, and sought various commodities. While these contacts and intrusions created both challenges and opportunities for indigenous communities, lslanders were also fascinated by the exoticism of Europeans, and depicted ships, Europeans and aspects of European life on a range of artefacts. This dance paddle, carved in lightweight wood for swift manipulation in the course of performance, takes a customary form: the human form with a headdress on the top would have been conventional at the time it was made, The body of the paddle, however, features a plethora of images of dogs, dogs copulating, roosters. birds, and settlers pointing rifles, one of whom carries both a pistol and a knife through his belt. The paddle also depicts several knives of European manufacture - likely to have been valued articles of trade frorn the Melanesian perspective - pigs, crocodiles and a man smoking a pipe. While it is impossible to recover the unknown artist's perspective upon these subjets, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that these representations were intended to be comic, delighting in the oddity of the men and their appearance.The paddle was collected by Imperial Governor Rudolf ven Bennigsen, the first govemor of German New Guinea, notorious for several brutal missions of 'pacification' during his short tenure (18gg-1901). He undertook surveying cruises to Bougainville and adjacent islands in 1900.\r\n\r\n (Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts, p. 302)" .
