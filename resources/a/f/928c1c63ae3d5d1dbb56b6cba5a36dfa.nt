<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/80bbbe829d0500249cb8cb87edd86df6> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This gourd is made from a special longish pumpkin. It is probably planted only for the production of gourds. This pumpkin is constricted in the middle with a strip of cotton while growing, so that it is shaped like an hourglass. It is hollowed out and a small opening is put into it where the stem was. The outside is decorated with lines and pattern, which are burnt into the surface. This is the work of the men, who took a glowing stick to do it. \r\nSeveral patterns can be identified, although it is not clear what they mean or whether they are unique to certain clans. Some gourds have a black or patterned belt at the constriction. Above and below the constriction are mostly symmetrical patterns and lines. This gourd has parallel belts, which don't close.\r\nAll of the gourds are used to store and transport lime, which is used for the consummation of betel. They are put into bags or carried under the arm. There is always a spatula that is used with a gourd. \r\nThe gourds can also serve as part of the bride price. \r\nWhen a relative visits from far away, he is welcomed with a gourd which is put under his arm. With this, he is invited to chew betel with the host. He is henceforth a protected guest in the house. \r\nThe betel chewing is an important, everyday activity. Women, men and even children do it while sitting together talking or on almost all other occasions. The consummation can be compared to the smoking of cigarettes in Western societies. It has been practised for a long time. An unripe areca or commonly known betel nut is chewed together with a leaf from the betel pepper. Then the lime, which is made by burning coral or shells, is added to the mixture in the mouth. The lime dissolves the alkaloids in the betel nut which have a stimulating effect, as much as they relieve fatigue and hunger. The mixture is not swallowed.\r\nThe betel colours the saliva and the teeth bright red. The betel is said to preserve the teeth from decay, but it also causes the gum to recede so that the teeth fall out. Old people which have no teeth have to grind the mixture in a mortar.\r\n\r\nTo this gourd belongs a wooden spatula. This spatula is made from wood, probably palm wood. It is carved from one piece, as all spatulas are. One end is flat and broad. The middle part is round in diameter and longish. The handle of the spatula is carved into two human figures which stand with their backs to each other. One is a man and one is a woman. Their feet, upper legs and heads are connected. It looks like they are wearing hats which stick out vertically. The figures represent deceased direct relatives, whose memory is kept alive. The wood is very smooth, as it was put in the mouth and no splinters should come off. It was the men's work to manufacture the spatulas, although it was used by men and women, sometimes even children. First, the wood is hewn with an adze. The shape of the spatula is then carved out with a shell knife. The wood is smoothened with leaves from bamboo and other plants which had the effect of sand paper. \r\nSpatulas are found everywhere on the Admiralty islands. In the northwest of the main island Manus, short and broad spatulas with relatively few decoration are dominant. Longer and thinner spatulas with a rich decoration in form of three-dimensional animals and human figures originate on Rambutjo island and are more common on the south coast. \r\nThe spatula was stuck in a gourd and was used to bring the powdery lime from the gourd into the mouth for betel chewing. The lime was mixed in the mouth with betel pepper and areca nut and it helped to extract the active substance from the betel." .
