Volgens van Roon de Dans van de Vleermuizen, Danza de los Murcialagos, in Guerrero. Cordry laat vleermuismaskers zien uit de Heer der Dierendans. Zie opmerkingen.\r\nPolychroom beschilderd houtsnijwerk met een vleermuis van papier-maché.\r\n\r\nIn Mesoamerican cultures the use of masks dates from 3000 years ago. Murals and Codices have left evidence that masks were used by priests to summon the power of deities and as funerary masks for dignitaries. \r\nAfter the Spanish conquest masks were used to catechize the native population through dramatic representations of Christian stories. \r\nNowadays masks (and costumes) are used in communal ceremonial dances, particularly for the celebration of patron saint day, Carnival and Christmas. These traditional Mexican masks are usually made by a mask maker and rarely by the dancers. \r\n\r\nFrom: Bats in South American Folklore and Ancient Art by Elizabeth P. Benson:\r\nThe people of ancient cultures venerated creatures who, to them, symbolized anomaly and transformation. The bat is one of these. For many cultures, it was–and is still–a kind of intermediary to the gods, partly because of its uniqueness, partly because it fits into, and contributes to, man’s environment. \r\nThe gods of the Sky and the Underworld were the most important Pre-Columbian deities largely because agriculture depended upon them both. As flying creatures, bats signify the sky, but they have many qualifications for Underworld symbolism as well. They hang upside-down, facing the Underworld; they are nocturnal (the Underworld is dark); they roost in caves or dead trees and use streams as flyways (caves, tree roots, and streams were considered openings into the Underworld). In New World myth and art, the Underworld was one of the most important themes. It was where the dead were buried and the place from where plants came. Death imagery in Pre-Columbian art has regeneration significance in the same manner as the green plant coming from the dry seed. \r\nThey likely saw bats visiting the flowers of trees and other plants. Some of the plants most important to people in the New World tropics are bat-dependent. For example, bats pollinate the kapok (or silk-cotton) tree (Ceiba pentrandra), which was sacred in many regions. Its fiber is used for making blow gun darts and canoes are made from its wood. Ancient people found ghostly pale stunted plants growing in caves where fruit-eating bats roost and drop seeds. Bats also deposit the seeds of the breadnut tree (Brosimum alicastrum), which produces an important staple food, in caves in eastern Mexico. Today, local people still gather the seeds, seeing them as gifts of the gods, a kind of recognition of the contributions of bats. \r\nTobacco continues to be an important ritual plant in many places. Both bats and tobacco are associated with shamans (native priests). The Bororo, a tribe in Brazil, tell a story about men casually smoking one night. A vampire bat flew by and told them that, if they did not smoke reverently, they would be punished, “because this tobacco is mine.” (Plants are often “owned” by animals in South American myths.) According to the story, the men who disobeyed the bat were turned into otters. \r\nAnother possible aspect of the tobacco relationship is the fact that fire often occurs with bats in folklore (although it may also derive from observing large numbers of bats emerging from a cave at twilight, often appearing like a great cloud of smoke). In folk tales, supernatural bats often burn their victims or they are themselves destroyed by fire. In addition, natural fires in caves sometimes occur from spontaneous combustion of bat guano. Although bat depictions on Pre-Columbian artifacts do not hint at fire or smoke, the cultural association of bats with fire suggests that bats might have had similar connotations in ancient times." .
