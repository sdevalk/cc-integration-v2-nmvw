<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/e4c9fde869b839e17c7ebcfa490e11b1> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The mummy has the shape of a triangular body with rounded shoulder area, tapering to the caudal end. A raised ridge runs in the axis of the shoulder end, and the upper face of the body has facetted sides and a slightly concave centre, suggesting anatomical structures underneath. The upper and lower faces of the body are separated by a 4 cm wide band of yellowish-brown medium-fine linen (warp-faced tabby weave, about 11 x 36 threads/cm2) running around the perimeter. The upper face is carefully finished with a single sheet of pale linen (about 10 x 36 threads/cm2), secured by a gridded pattern composed of thin strips of doubled linen (width 0.3-0.5 cm) running in the two diagonal directions. The lower face, however, shows much decayed and blackened transverse bandages, with a larger sheet near the shoulder end. There are two concentric straps consisting of several windings of yarn, one around the tail end and the other about 11 cm further on. A sheet of modern gauze has been wrapped around the mummy during a recent restoration. Bron: The mummy has the shape of a triangular body with rounded shoulder area, tapering to the caudal end.
