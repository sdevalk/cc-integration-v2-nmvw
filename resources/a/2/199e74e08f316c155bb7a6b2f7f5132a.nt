It is made from a few flat pieces of sago-leaf stem put together with rattan. The bottom is painted white and the top part is in a dark colour with yellow dots. The sides are decorated with feathers. The flexible wooden stick (arib) is put through the hole and attached to the performer's headgear. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\nThe flying fox, an emblem of the Moyu-rek clan of the Geb-ze phratry, was carried by a waiko/dema performer in a mayo cult dance, waiko-zi, connected with the re-enactment of some particular mythical episode.\r\nDuring the mayo cult initiation ceremonies, the initiates imitate the flying foxes. \"In their hairdo they carry a long, elastic rod topped by a lustily swinging flying fox made of pieces of coconut husk and sago-leafstalks. ... A flower-stalk of the meri-coconut is fixed to the hairdo and their bodies are covered with coconut-leaves, ... . It is an enactment of the myth of Meru\" (Van Baal, 1966: 518-519) [about the introduction of the coconut (Van Baal, 1966: 254 f)].\r\n\r\nThe myths reveal the relationship between these creatures and young novices which have turned into flying foxes and flew overseas to bring flowers of a coconut. As a result of that, the mythological flying foxes themselves can change into coconut palm trees. According to Wirz this is a reference to the natural fact of \"the symbiosis of flying foxes and coconut palm, of which they eat the young nuts\" (ibid.: 255).\r\n\r\nThe image of a flying fox can also be found on some taboo signs (sar-ahai), particularly those in the tabooed coconut garden. Therefore, the ornaments of flying foxes are proper to the coconut dema (Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 34).\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 28.11. 2006" .
