<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/9692b35888cfc1a755176b323fa42025> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The title of this chalk drawing is ‘Freedom Fighters’ and, more than the other works in our collection (TM-1773-1 t/m -4, TM-5900-1), speaks to Nola Hatterman's interest in the anti-colonial resistance.\r\nIn the 1930s Nola Hatterman criticized Hitler’s racial doctrine of the Aryan ideal of beauty. In 1939 she had her first solo exhibition with mainly portraits of mostly black people.\r\nIn the second half of the 40s her theme changed into ‘the world of the oppressed, but militant black people’. Freedom Fighters is a good example of that theme. Nola Hatterman came into contact with the anti-fascist Surinamese labour movement and Surinamese communists during the 30s. After the war she connected and build relationships with Surinamese students and the Wie Eegie Sanie organisation. It is then when she started developing her interest in the maroon resistance in Suriname as well." .
