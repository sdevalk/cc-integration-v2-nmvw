It is attached to a carrying strap consisting of nine strings, wrapped in red-dyed porcupine quills.\r\n\r\nThe warp and weft of this pouch is a vegetal fiber, most probably “Indian hemp” (dogbane, apocynum). Bags and pouches of this type were woven upside down by a process known as “finger weaving” or “loose warp weaving:” the warp strands were hanging loose over a horizontal cord. The fabric was created from the top down by a continuous horizontal weft twisted (twined) around the warp strands. During this process the decoration was applied by means of “false embroidery:” the wrapping of colored moosehair around the twining weft elements. As a result, the design is only visible on one surface. False embroidery covers the whole body of this pouch. Once the fabric was of the desired size, the ends of the warp strands were brought together in separate bundles, wrapped with red-dyed porcupine quills, and braided together in the upper edge of the pouch.\r\n\r\nThe geometric designs decorating this and similar pouches are representative of aboriginal art before the adoption of curvilinear and floral designs derived from colonial European folk art. Most interesting is the visual interplay of color reversals, resembling patterns found in more recent silk ribbon appliqué work in the Midwest. When the quill-wrapped strings of the carrying strap are arranged side by side they reveal a repeating pattern of red diamonds against a white and black background.\r\n\r\nAltogether only six pouches of this type have survived. They are assumed to be of Iroquoian origin, in view of their similarity in materials, construction, and decoration with burden straps of the Iroquois proper and the Hurons. Another undecorated pouch of this type has been found during archaeological research at a Seneca-Iroquois village site, inhabited ca. 1670-1687 (Drooker 2004). The largest portion of surviving Huron people were absorbed into the Iroquois population by this date. One of the six surviving decorated pouches is in the British Museum, documented as of Huron origin, made some time before 1725. Also the three examples in the Musée du quai Branly in Paris were almost certainly acquired about the same time. All existing evidence favors an identification of these pouches as originating from Huron Indians in the early 1700s. The function of these pouches is unknown, but more than likely they were made to carry hunting charms, as recorded by early observers.\r\n\r\nAmong the Huron living near Quebec City in the 1770s a distinctly new art style developed under the influence of French nuns. Huron women used dyed moosehair in their embroidery of clothing, moccasins and bags, often of black-dyed deerskin. Curvilinear designs were combined with earlier patterns in quillwork and by the 1820s this developed into a complex floral art style. Applied to decorate a variety of practical and decorative objects used by white families, outside demand stimulated this development.\r\n\r\nTed J.

The designs possible refer to the different worlds with their respective supernatural spirit beings: the underworld with the underwater panthers, and the upper world with the thunderbirds, responsible for storm and lightning. The geoemetrif design are possibly derived from tattoos, a custom that went gradually out of fashion in the second half of the 18th century as Indians began increasingly covering their bodies with western or western-style clothes. Both Iroquoian and Algonqiuan Indians of the Great Lakes area made and carried these on a strap on their back, filled with necessities, including tobacco." .
