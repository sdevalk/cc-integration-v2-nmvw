The many different colors (aniline-based) and fine weave enable many and complex patterns, although their maker's degree of skill is obvious in each specimen. Typical are one or two lengthwise bands with a repeating geometric design in between. The long sides of belts were often beaded with one row in one color, usually white, such as in this specimen. Such bands were sewn onto garments on the breast and along hems and cuffs. They were also used as burden straps for carrying game bags. Fading is seen regularly in museum specimens (such as in this one) because of the fugitive nature of the aniline-based dyes.\r\nPH" .
