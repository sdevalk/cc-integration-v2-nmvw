It has a very long wooden handle and a forked wooden shaft, into which two obsidian blades are stuck, one on each fork. The joint between handle and shaft is tightly wound with fibre cord and then coated with a layer of Parinarium. Fibre cords are also wound diagonally around the joint on top of the coat to create rhomboid patterns which are coloured in white and black. The wooden joint is shaped like a triangle with a hole in the middle. It is painted with white, black and red lines. The blades are furthermore secured with a long fibre cord which is wound around each blade very tightly. It is painted with rhomboid patterns in white and red. One blade is broken off. \r\nThis kind of double-headed spear was probably not used as a weapon at all but rather as a ceremonial dancing object held by men. \r\nSplinters and bigger parts of obsidian, which were needed for the daggers and spears were hewn off with stones. This was done by expert men, who exactly knew the physical qualities  of the stone and therefore knew where to hit. Most of  of the blades were pear-shaped with the biggest lower part being attached to the wooden shaft. All the obsidian is originally from Lou Island, whose people at first had the monopoly on spears and daggers with obsidian blades. Through trade relations though, the obsidian also spread across to the main island and the little islands around, which then started to manufacture those weapons themselves. Deep shafts were dug out, in which men worked with torches to produce the obsidian. Big blocks of it were either directly processed on Lou island or traded to the other islands. In the period of 3,200 to 2,500 years ago, the Lou Island obsidian had been transported to places as far as Borneo in the west and Vanuatu in the east, covering a span of 5,700 km.\r\n\r\nMost of the weapons for European collectors and museums were collected between 1876 and 1910. The popularity of weapons can be ascribed to the reputation of the Admiralty Islanders as being independent and wild. On the other hand, Europeans were generally fascinated by weapons from societies they felt were still savage and primitive. Thus the prevalence of weapons in all the collections." .
