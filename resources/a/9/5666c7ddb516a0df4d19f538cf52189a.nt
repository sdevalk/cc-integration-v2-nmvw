The village itself is located some 400 kms to the east of Darwin, and nearly 30 kms from the Arafura Sea. It is a relatively new settlement, having only been established in the early 1970's. \r\n\r\nEarlier, in the 1960's an outstation of Milingimbi was set up at Nangalalala [ 8 kms N/E of Ramingining], a kilometre or so from the Glyde River. Ther older settlement Milingimbi Mission, was established in 1926 and is in fact situated on an island a few kilometres off the north Australia coastline. Nangala is still in existence, and is now considered an outstation of Ramingining.\r\nThe area around Ramingining on the mainland is home for the Djinang speaking Wurrkigenydjarr/Marrangu, Wulaki, Mildjingi, Balmbi and Murrungun clans.  In a wider circle are the Burarra, Rembarrnga, Wudamin, Ganalbingu and Manharrngu peoples. To the north are the Gorryindi, Gamalangga, Malarra and Walamangu peoples who look after the Crocodile Islands. Other people who live there and have ceremonial connections are members of the Gupapuyngu, Djambarrpuyngu, Wagilag, Liyagalawumir and Liya-gawumirr groups.  \r\nThe particular tract of land upon which Ramingining township is built is owned by the Djadawitjibi people, of the Djiang group. Their principal creative being is Garrtjambal, the kangaroo.\r\nSome 10-20 kms to the south of the village of Ramingining, where the looping Glyde River becomes the Goyder, is the large Arafura Swamp. Some 250 sq kms in area, this unique fresh water environment is home for an innumerable variety of water birds (including gurramatji, the magpie goose), fresh water plants, fields of water lilies, crocodiles, water snakes, insect life, and the magnificent and rare Corypha elata palm. (hundred year palm?).\r\n\r\n\r\nBARKPAINTING, ARNHEMLAND\r\n\r\nThe first barkpaintings  probably were on the inside of rain shelters. Lengths of Eucalyptus  bark were attached with their smooth insides to simple frames of branches. People then would decorate the bark during periods of forced idleness. 19th century explorers reported that barkpaintings were an important factor in rituals and ceremonies. Today this is still the case in Arnhem Land. The choice and treatment of subjects was limited by cultural and religious traditions. Some of the paintings could only be exposed.\r\n\r\nThe wet season is the best time to harvest the bark because it is flexible then and easy to remove. With a sharp axe two rings are cut into the trunk. These are subsequently connected wioth a vertical cut. As the bark is flexible and damp it is easy to peel off. The loose bark on the outside is chopped away. Subsequently, the remaining bark s put on a steady burning fire face down. Because of the heat the bark flattens and the moisture evaporates. Weighed down with stones the bark is left for a few days. Later, to keep the bark from warping sometimes sticks are attached to the top and the bottom.\r\n\r\nArnhem Land artists only rarely use other colours than the basic red, yellow, black and white. The red and yellow derive from the ochres that are found in the ochre pits. Black stems from charcoal. White is made from plaster or pipe clay. The material is finely ground and mixed with water, added with a binder. The simple throw-away brushes are made of bark fibres, human hair, chewed twigs and thin shoots.\r\nPortrayed are subjects related to daily life. On the coast, for example the hunting of kangaroos, fresh water crocodiles and birds. Other images have to do with personal totem stories and Dreamtime histories.\r\n\r\nWithin Arnhem Land art there are distinct regional styles. The famous x-ray style is mostly found in the western part. Not only the outside of a human being, animal or spirit is painted, but als important organs and the spine. These paintings often have a plain background and one or two figures, one of them being a Mimi spirit. The most important parts of the work are covered with cross lines. These patterns are individual, every artist having his own pattern.\r\nWhen we look at the choice of subject and technique, there is a strong resemblance to the old rockpaintings in the area. The art in the northern and eastern part of Arnhem Land is more colourful and intricate. Often the, the whole bark is covered with figures and abstract, geometric patterns. Frequently, there is a border around the painting and the work is divided into segments representing different stories. \r\nIn central Arnhem Land there is more an exchange between the different groups. Art here is open to change. The composition is more important than the intricate attention to details and thus acquires greater vitality." .
