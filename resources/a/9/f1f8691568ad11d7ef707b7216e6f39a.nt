<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/b7f6ca7a0817f8ef109cca6304fabaf8> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Archaeological evidence indicates that during prehistoric and Historic period in the Southeast basketry included mats and baskets used for storing, transporting, gathering and processing food and interring the dead. Basket making is a women's craft with specific rules designating which women are allowed to make a special kind of basket. For example, grandmothers or older women past menopause can make certain baskets to protect the power of the medicine. The traditional raw material for basketry in Louisiana is cane (Arundinaria tecta) but is has almost disappeared because of changing agricultural practices. Since 1920's the needles of the Longleaf Pine (Pinus palustrus) have proved to be a sufficient replacement of cane. At the same time, the raffia palm fiber (Raphia farinifera) substituted the elm inner-bark (Ulmus) which was used to stitch the coils together. Today practically all Koasati basketry is made of coiled pine needles with raffia. \tThis elephant is made of coiled pine needles sewn together with raffia. Natural materials are used to dye red. All kinds of animal effigy baskets are very popular among collectors. Made for tourist industry." .
