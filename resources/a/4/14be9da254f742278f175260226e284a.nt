The tomb dates from the Middle Bronze Age II (c. 2000 - 1500 BC). It was part of a group of everyday objects left in the tomb of the deceased person as a series of grave gifts meant to help the deceased in the afterlife. This particlar vase was used to contain food to be eaten in the afterlife. Remains of food and drink have been found in many of the ceramics discovered at the cemetary in Jericho. However, little is known about the context in which the jars were placed in the grave. Were they made for the burial or were they used during the deceased lifetime? Was there a religious significance to their presence in the tomb? It is believed now that there was a set 'kit' of ceramics that was usually placed in tombs during this period. \r\n\r\nThis vase was excavated in the 1950s as part of Kathleen Kenyon's excavations at Jericho. It is numbered J20-55 in keeping with the excavation recording method. The Dutch archaeologist Henk Franken participated in her excavations and loaned this group of ceramics from tomb J20 to the Tropenmuseum in 1963. He also sold the entirety of Tomb P23 to the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden (Dutch National Museum of Antiquities) in Leiden in 1958.\r\n\r\nKenyon, K. M. (1960) Excavations at Jericho.
