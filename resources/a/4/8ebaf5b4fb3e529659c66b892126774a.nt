Schmeltz; beschrijvingskaart)\r\n\r\nMulyeddie, nosestick of brownish wood; the thickest in the midst, both ends pointed; section elliptic. Towranna-plains.\r\n\r\nThe \"una\"dance is one of the most weird spectacles imaginable.\r\nSome 30 or 40 men (more in larger tribes), feather ornaments on head and upper arms, a wurrindi, or bunch of Emu-feathers [see No's: 1321-18 and 1321-19], coloured with wilgie hanging behind, from a hair-belt tied around the waist, a muljeddie of wood [see No: 1207-73 and 1207-96] or Kangaroo-bone [see No. 1321-27], trough the septum of the nose, and painted with white and red stripes across the face, chest, abdomen and thighs, suddenly spring with a yell from the outer darkness into the bright fire circle.\r\n\r\nA short strong spear (about 6 feet long) in each hand, held perpendicularly, the shaft touching the ground, the body bent forward, eyes rolling and teeth glistening, they stamp with feet and spear shafts on the ground, keeping time to the songs of the old men, who click their kailis [see No's\"1207-46 and 1207-44] together and rattle their mihras [see No's: 1207-7, 1207-9 and 1321-66]." .
