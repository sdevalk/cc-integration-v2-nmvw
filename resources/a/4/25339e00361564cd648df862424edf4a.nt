Yvan, Paris, 1885\r\n\r\n\tThrough the 18th century to about 1930 Algonkian-speaking Montagnais- Naskapi hunters (now called Innu) of the Quebec-Labrador Peninsula believed that a new, carefully constructed and beautifully painted caribou skin coat was essential to success during the annual fall caribou hunt. Such coats embodied collective artistic, spiritual and moral power. Worn during both pre-hunt ceremonies and the hunt itself, these striking coats so honored the prey that the Lord of the Caribou would, in reciprocity, send the animals out from the Magical Mountain to give themselves up to the hunters. That a coat’s power was thought to have left it after a year may explain why a number of museums have been able to acquire them (Podolinsky 1983; Burnham 1992).\r\n \r\n\tWhile the earliest (late 17th century) Naskapi painted coats hang straight from the shoulders to the hem, this coat exhibits the influence of early to mid 18th century flare-skirted Euro-Canadian men’s coats. It has been cut from three especially large, softly tanned, medium weight caribou skins, one used for the front, one for the back, and the third for the sleeves, cuffs, inserts and collar. The seams are overcast-stitched from the inside using finely twisted caribou backbone sinew inserted into awl-punched holes.\r\n  \r\nLike most Naskapi coats, this was designed with an open front and was worn with a sash. Its set-in sleeves and seaming at the shoulders and along the bodice sides as far as the waist are characteristic. Below the waist the back skin has been cut to extend out almost horizontally on either side so that when sewn to the front these horizontal edges complete the coat’s side seams and cause the lower back to fall from the waist into multiple, graceful folds on either side of a large inserted triangular gusset. This central gusset is thought to represent the Magical Mountain from which the caribou are released. The coat is missing the rounded back collar; the paint is worn or has run in places.\r\n \r\n\tNaskapi hunting coats are elegantly ornamented with elaborate patterning that follows general conventions. Some seams were sewn before the coat was painted in order to smoothly continue the painted bands that cross over seams on the sleeves, the lower sides and the back gusset. A broad painted hem band provides a visual base for five to seven painted triangular gores, the central one painted over the inserted triangular gusset. This coat includes three painted gores on either side of the back gusset. Painted bands circle the sleeves at the wrists, the elbows, and just below the shoulder joint, reflecting an indigenous circumpolar emphasis on marking joints on garments and thereby acknowledging them as centers of being that must be respected in regard to both animals and humans.\r\n\r\n\tThe painting on this Naskapi coat follows conventional guidelines of the mid-18th century regarding colors, motif configuration and placement. Caribou bone tools carved with one or more blunt-ended prongs were used for painting single or multiple parallel lines and a small curved bone blade to draw fine, straight lines and tight curves. What is now a somewhat faint and darkened yellow pigment secured from the strained liquid of suckerfish roe was used to lay out the overall patterning and create crosshatching within motifs. The red and blue are likely vermillion and Prussian blue acquired from traders, while the black possibly came from burnt bone.\r\n\r\n\tAll gore forms on Naskapi coats are painted. The origin of most motifs is unclear but the long established art of birch bark biting appears to have been one inspiration. By the mid-18th Century when this coat was made, a geometric gore on either side under the arm was standard. These contrasted dramatically with the other gores and the center back gusset where complex, often plant-like motifs had become conventional. On this coat the side gores with their stacked horizontal bands of pendant triangles contrast quietly with the five gores of particularly elegant foliate-like double curve motifs (Speck 1914; Richardson 1963). As the double curves on either side drop sharply away from the motif’s upper point with its crosshatched double lobes, they swell to become leaf-like then tightly curl upwards at the ends. Plant-like tendrils drip from the curls and a central bud-like form emerges, topped with a circle. The hem and cuffs repeat this core motif but without the upper and lower additions.\r\n\r\n\tThis garment remains an important example of a mid-18th Century Naskapi hunting coat.  Its flamboyantly cut back and modest but subtly elegant painted motifs document a period when Montagnais-Naskapi women experimented with introduced clothing styles, pigments and motifs as they continued to create hunting coats to embody sufficient artistic, spiritual and moral power to ensure a successful hunt of the caribou on which they depended for survival.\r\n\r\nKate C.

Dit komt vooral naar voren in de sterke taillering.\r\n\r\nAls zodanig is deze jagersjas een fraai voorbeeld van het laten prevaleren van ijdelheid over praktische overwegingen, zowel bij de Fransen als bij de Indianen. Langs de hele onderkant is deze van kariboehuid vervaardigde jas over een breedte van ruim tien cm. met curvilineaire motieven beschilderd. Ook de manchetten en andere plaatsen op de mouw zijn van een gelijksoortige versiering voorzien. Voorts is een beschildering aangebracht over een baan op de rug en langs de sluiting van voren. Jassen van dit type werden - tot omstreeks 1918 - door de jagers van de Naskapi en de Montagnais, gedurende slechts een jachtseizoen gedragen. Men hoopte dat de jas de drager geluk zou brengen bij de jacht. Daar deze zich vooral toespitste op het vangen van kariboes, zou men kunnen veronderstellen dat de dubbele gebogen rode lijnen, het \"dubbele curve-motief\" in de beschildering, kariboegeweien voorstellen. Dit motief komt veel voor in het oostelijk Subarctisch gebied.\r\nDe kraag ontbreekt." .
