Equestrian nomadism enabled tribes to exploit the buffalo herds throughout the year. The acquisition of horses increasingly became an incentive for intertribal raiding. Much of the Spanish equine material culture accompanied the spread of the horse throughout the Southwest, Plains and beyond. Plains Indian horsemen used quirts and horse whips to spurn their mounts. They came in various types, from simple flat and round ones with partially braided hide lashes such as this example, to complex and elaborate ones, with carved designs, painting, decorative patterns in brass tacks, beaded wrist straps, and feather and beaded pendants. Handles were made from wood or antler. Within tribes the different types were distinguished by different terms. A specific type of quirt is made from twisted horsehair, woven in a style called soumak, a much sought after article in intertribal trade, imported from South America, or obtained from the few Southwestern Indian craftspeople who might have learned this difficult technique (Dorsey 1896:280; Wissler 1915:27-29; Conn 1955; cf. Densmore 1948:204; Brasser 1976:78; Thompson 1977:164; Coe 1976: 169; Hassrick and Markoe 1986:139-40; Conn 1979:117; 1992:44,141; Maurer et.al. 1992:112; Penney 1992:264-266; Hanson 1994:39; Pohrt 1978).\r\nThrough a hole in the end of the handle was looped a braided woolen strap, with a piece of cotton. Although this quirt is a strictly utilitarian object, others could be lavishly decorated with carvings, brass tacks, and quilled and beaded wrist straps. Besides for spurning horses, quirts were used to count coup on enemies, and to punish transgressors (Pohrt 1978; Hanson 1996:38).\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)" .
