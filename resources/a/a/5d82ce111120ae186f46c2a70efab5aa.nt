(without fringe) 103 cm.; ca. 1880.\r\nThis is a quiver-like carrying case for a rifle, narrow at the bottom, and wide enough for the rifle butt at the top, with a wide carrying strap. The seam is stitched with a buckskin thong, and edged with red flannel. The lower portion and bottom of the scabbard have buckskin fringes. A wide, decorative tab at the top has a serrated edge and cutouts to reveal the red flannel beneath. The gun case was purchased in Santa Fe in July 1883 from a merchant who obtained them from Mescaleros who had been at the Tertio-Millennial Exposition.\r\n\tLike arrow quivers, rifle scabbards undoubtedly could also be heavily decorated with beadwork. Ewing (1982:170) illustrates an elaborately beaded and fringed 1880s example from the Southern Plains, identified as Apache, but not to tribe. Mails (1974:280) illustrates a Western Apache example decorated with ribbons, but does not give its age.\r\nTen Kate pointed out that Western Apaches were not communal horseback warriors like Plains tribes, but practiced guerilla warfare, well adapted to the mountain environments of Arizona. Apaches operated in small groups which carried out hit-and-run attacks. A thorough knowledge of the landscape, physical endurance, determination, and courage qualified young men to become respected warriors. Apaches were a hardened people because of their environment and way of life. With a clinical tone (as befits a physical anthropologist) mixed with a touch of romanticism, Ten Kate noted the Apaches' slender but muscular bodies, a gait which he compared to that of a tiger, and a piercing gaze. Many chiefs and warriors showed old scars and recent injuries. At San Carlos, Chief Loco discussed the cause of his five major wounds with the anthropologist, and Ten Kate noted that the left half of Loco's face bore the signs of heavy trauma and that he was blind in his left eye. Chiefs, called nahntáhn, had reputations based on their success in leading raids. However, authority was quickly lost when physical prowess waned, enabling ambitious young warriors to prove themselves and ascend to positions of leadership. Old Nané, and especially Loco, were cases in point. Ten Kate also encountered Eskiminzin, who had fought with Geronimo, but had turned to a quiet life of farming.\r\n\tIn pre-reservation times, bows and arrows were used for hunting, and as weapons in raiding (to steal property) or warfare (to exact revenge by killing people). Lances and clubs were mainly offensive weapons used in war. In early times, arrows and lances were tipped with flaked stone points, replaced in later years with metal points on arrows, and long metal blades on lances, the latter sometimes made from captured Spanish, Mexican, or American cavalry sabers. A distinctly Apache style of clubs for close combat, called zendízj (Ten Kate 2004:197), was made of a spherical stone, the size of a billiard ball, sewn into a rawhide covering and attached by a flexible thong to a handle. In the late 1800s, traditional weapons were almost completely replaced by rifles and handguns, with one, and often two, ammunition belts worn around the waist.\r\n\tFor protection, Apaches carried large, round, rawhide shields. Also worn on raids or in warfare were buckskin caps decorated with eagle, hawk or turkey feathers. Shields and caps were imbued with supernatural power to protect their owner, as were amulets and possibly painted buckskin shirts (see \"Clothing: Protective and Secular\" section above). By the time of Ten Kate's visit, a number of men still owned shields, and caps were still worn for protection against supernatural dangers." .
