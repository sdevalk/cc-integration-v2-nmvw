Although carved by the Sawos, malu appear primarily to have been traded to the neighboring Iatmul people, who used them in ceremonial contexts. Associated in Iatmul oral tradition with the origin of death, malu reportedly served to commemorate novices or initiators who died while in ritual seclusion as part of male initiation rites. The boards were displayed during public ceremonies marking the end of the initiation period, at which the women of the community first learned of the deaths. (website Metropolitan Museumof Art)" .
