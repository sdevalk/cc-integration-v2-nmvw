Black basalt is crushed and used as temper. Characteristic of the polychrome pottery are the red and black arches over stylized bird and rain motifs. After 1850 a typical bird-motif began to painted on much Zia pottery, becoming known as the Zia-bird, most resembling a roadrunner, and almost always portrayed in motion. Zia's major potter of the 1930s was Trinidad Medina who demonstrated her craft at the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago (1933) and the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco (1939). Seferina Bell gained a reputation in the 1950s. The Medinas, heirs to the art and craft of Rosalea Medina Toribio (deceased), are the major dynasty of potters of Zia (Bernstein 1990; Dillingham 1994:106-117; Hayes and Blom 1996:160-165).\r\n\r\nThe Zia-sunsymbol of \"friendship among cultures\" is depicted on the New Mexico state flag. The Corn Dance on the feast day of Our Lady of the Assumption on August 15 draws many spectators. Other dances to be obserbed are the Buffalo Dances on January 6 at at Christmas, and a variety of dances at Easter. The cultural center in the tribal offices complex contains a small museum displaying pottery and other arts and crafts.\r\n(Hovens 2002)\r\n\r\nRoodbruin aardewerk met zwart geometrisch d√©cor.
