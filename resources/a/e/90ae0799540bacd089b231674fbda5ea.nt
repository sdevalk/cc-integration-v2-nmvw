One side has a wider mouth, in which there is plaited another funnel, which goes into the outer tube. The smaller opening has a matching basket lid. To get the regular round tube, the skewers are laid around rattan rings during the manufacturing. The construction is quite rigid. \r\nThe trap was probably put in the water without bait and weighted down with stones, so that the fish would swim into it. \r\nThose traps were probably laid out by men, who also manufactured them." .
