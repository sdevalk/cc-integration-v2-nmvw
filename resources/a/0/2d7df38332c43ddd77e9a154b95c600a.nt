These names refer to their manufacturing technique, by which designs were carved out on solid wooden boards that had been covered by a thick layer of a composition of glue, lacquer and bone ash and then with a few layers of black or brown lacquer. The decorations were cut through the lacquer down to the surface of the composition and thereafter coloured with oil or lacquer pigments. The decorations often depict court scenes, episodes from the world of the immortals, panoramic or landscape views, and flora and fauna. In Europe, such lacquer had been called “Coromandel lacquer” from the nineteenth century onwards. This name refers to the Coromandel coast of India, where several European East India companies had trading posts in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and where such Chinese screens are thought to have been transshipped onto vessels heading for Europe. Lacquer has a long history in China; vessels such as bowls and boxes were made as early as the Eastern Zhou period (771–256 BC). Large screens were already in use by the Northern Song dynasty (960-1126) and were usually employed in entrance halls or as room dividers or windscreens for gardens and terraces. The most luxurious lacquer screens were produced at the imperial workshops inlaid with mother-of-pearl or tortoiseshell. It is believed that kuancai screens were developed in Southern China (around Fujian) as a cheaper alternative aimed at well-off merchants and civil servants. At the end of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), trade was flourishing in South China and a class of rich, highly cultured merchants had emerged, many of whom invested in art. As merchants, they were (by definition) at the bottom of the social scale. Some tried to improve their position through the civil service examinations. Once they had succeeded and had gained an official title, they wished to show off their status and had the financial means to do so. ‘The expression of good wishes was considered the highest form of respect and a Coromandel screen was one of the most valued but also one of the most expensive marks of respect.’ The kuancai screens and cabinets that would be made for export towards the end of the seventeenth century and the eighteenth century were of much lesser quality than the screens made for presentation to Chinese high-ranking military officers and officials." .
