Such games were played by two to eight men, sitting down and in turn threw a flat stone on the sticks. These jumped up in the air, and when fallen down, the marks showing on the sticks were counted. Scores were kept with little sticks and the stakes could be high. Games lasting a whole day could end in losing or winning a horse (Whittemore 1893:65). Ten Kate recorded the name for this game as keens√πh, a term he later identified as quince, a Spanish name signifying fifteen. In a note added to the gaming set Ten Kate noted that one stick of the set was lost in the luggage room of his hotel, but that he would try to get a complete set through an intermediary (cf. Culin 1907:150-151; Russell 1908:174-181).\r\n(Hovens 2009)\r\n\r\nKiense-spel bestaande uit drie halfronde stukken hout met tekeningen op de vlakke kant. This game is still known (but probably not played) by some of older women (W.Kaemlein, Ariz.State Mus)." .
