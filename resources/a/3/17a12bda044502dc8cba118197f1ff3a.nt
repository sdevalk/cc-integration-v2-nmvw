<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/IB2020-14-1> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This female figure is a representation of one of the first ancestors of Aitutaki, who arrived in the canoe of the navigator Ru; he had  left Tubuai in the Austral Islands because of the overpopulation and conflict. Ru came with his four brothers, his four wives and twenty chiefly maidens who settled the land of Aitutaki; the land is still divided among their descendants. Our recent interpretation of the patterns on her body identifies the carved, serrated lines on both sides of the figure as representations of her spine, a symbol of the succession of generations, of genealogy in the form of superimposed figures. The same pattern can be seen on many so-called slab gods and on a large chief's seat from Aitutaki. According to Aitutakian researcher Ngaa Kitai Pureariki this pattern is called mou mou rima, litteraly 'holding hands; it expresses the importance of connectedness to nature and fertility as the origin of humankind and at the same time the importance of the continuity of generations into the future. The painted patterns represent tattoos that, on the one hand, refer to certain founding canoes, and on the other, to the ara metua, the 'ancient path of the ancestors'. This term not only denotes a certain type of genealogy, but also the birth channel, the passage a child takes to emerge from te po, the beginning of all things. Another pattern called vaine para kite ao s related to all the skills a girl has to learn in order to Ã©merge into the world as a woman'. Thus all the tattoo patterns on the figure are reminders of the foundation values of the traditional culture of Aitutaki.\r\n\r\n(Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts, p.287)" .
