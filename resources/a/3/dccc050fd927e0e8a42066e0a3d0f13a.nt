<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7106-521-8> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "CHRIS PEASE\r\nBorn 1969, south coast of Western Australia\r\nLives in Perth, Western Australia\r\nMinang / Nyoongar language\r\nThoughts on first contact\r\nLithograph in two colours, printed from two aluminium plates\r\nDrawn on the plates by the artist and printed by Martin King at Australian Print Workshop, 2006\r\nImage size: 40 x 60cm Paper size: 56 x 76cm\r\nI thought of the Dutch vessels and the idea of the wooden hulls containing and protecting the sailors from the harsh environment outside. The hull, and in particular the ribs of a ship, protect the lives within, just as the ribs of an animal protect its organs. Dutch ship-building during the seventeenth century was in its prime. In contrast to this technology, the ships sailed into primeval territory. In 1621 the Leeuwin carne into contact with Nyoongar boodja (land), home to the humpback whale, the southern giant petrel and of course the Nyoongar people. My research into the Dutch voyages has parallels with much of the research I have undertaken on my own people: the gathering together of pieces of information to construct a complete picture." .
