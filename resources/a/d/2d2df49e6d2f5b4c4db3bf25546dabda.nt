Schildering in literatenstijl met elementen van de volksschilderkunst.\r\n\r\nSiberian tigers (Panthera Tigris Altaica) used to roam the entire Korean peninsula, from the mountain forests in the northeast to the rugged seacoast of the southwest. The last recorded capture of a tiger in South Korea was in 1922 ; the species is probably extinct today. The original habitat of the Siberian tiger included northeastern China and Siberia as well as Korea. Tiger claws, teeth, whiskers, and other parts were considered essential in certain Chinese and Korean folk medicines. In Korea, tiger bones were used to make a liquor called hogolju.\r\nTiger paintings are among the most delightful of all Korean folk art. They were displayed in Choson dynasty households at New Year's in order to protect the family against evil throughout the coming year. The tiger is the most powerful of the many evil-repelling animals in Korean mythology." .
