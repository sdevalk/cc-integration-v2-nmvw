After 1904 the currency was decimalized with 100 Heller being worth 1 Rupie. The Rupie in turn was pegged to the German Mark with 15 Rupien worth 20 Mark.\r\n\r\nBoth the German East African Rupie and the British East African Rupee were named after the Indian Rupee which was a common trade coin circulating in East Africa." .
