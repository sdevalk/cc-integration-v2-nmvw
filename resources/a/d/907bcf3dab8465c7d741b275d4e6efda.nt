It plays with the recurring theme of wealth and representation in art. The piece consists of coins collected by the museum on open-call for coins from all around the world, a myriad of currencies. His assembled sculpture is a metal gold-plated bed, with golden mattress and pillows. He chose to dedicate the piece to the anonymous artists whose works were housed in the collection and their interaction with the anonymous visitors who would view them. \r\n\r\nIn speaking about his work, in his artist proposal he says: “The gold is a[n] imperishable material, I use it for its color and to protect the bed and its mattress in order to give it an eternal life, that, however, should be sustained. This is to me what the museum represents.\r\nThe coins from all over the world represent all artworks from different countries and the visitors from different countries who came to this museum.”\r\n\r\nHe intended for his piece to be permanent long lasting and durable. As well as, chosen to be in a location in the back of the museum under the willow tree by the water for resting, napping, laying, or contemplating. \r\n\r\nIt is one of the few pieces which has lasted through the time since the public commission of works for the redesign of the Volkenkunde." .
