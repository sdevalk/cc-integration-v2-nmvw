<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/985247d2ecb563deb53b86bacc4c270e> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This Plateau bomber jacket is made of green silk, velvet detailing and wool by Marc Jacobs. The design of the jacket is cut by Okuma who has also executed the beadwork on the front and the back. The beadwork uses vintage (19th century) beads in a number of recognizable colours from historic clothing that evoke Plateau style beadwork – with wide banding and colour blocking in different colours, including greasy yellow, greasy purple, Cheyenne pink, midnight blue, sage green. The beading is bordered on the top and the bottom by Szarkowski crystals and vintage sequins respectively.\r\nThis bomber jacket is part of a series of three made in 2019. A previous series included Japanese textile. This series of three included one with dentalium shell only, another with dentalium shell and beading, and this jacket with beading evoking the curved beaded designs on the yokes of traditional hide dresses.\r\nDesigned to be worn together with the joggers (7207-2), scarf (7207-3), hat (7207-4) and shoes (7207-5)." .
