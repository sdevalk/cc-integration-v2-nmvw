The project was intended to help guide potters to make a better quality of pottery, receive a fairer and higher price for their pottery, and educate buyers about Pueblo pottery.  Pueblo pottery at this time was usually sold by the wagonload or sack full to curio dealers for pennies. The curio stores sold the work as souvenirs to travellers. The Pottery Improvement Project was designed to stop the cheapening sales of souvenir pottery. The museum provided a venue the sale of well-made pottery. The pottery selected for inclusion in the museum project was expected to serve as an example to other potters about what was good pottery.\r\n\r\nEach pot included in the Project was selected by the museum curators and offered for sale through the museum. Buying pottery through the museum helped assure buyers that they were purchasing authentic and the highest quality of work. This shallow dish is one of a relatively small group of pots that can be definitely identified as being purchased through the program. All of the pots known to be part of the project were made by either Maria and Julian Martinez or by Tonita Roybal.  The project was designed by museum curator Kenneth Chapman, a direct outgrowth of about a decade of encouraging San Ildefonso potters to continue to find viable reasons to make Pueblo pottery in the face of accelerating industrialization and the availability of manufactured goods and increasing pressure by the U.S. government to acculturate and leave behind their Native cultures.\r\n   \r\nFrom the Museum of New Mexico’s inception, it involved itself with Pueblo potters and helping to preserve their arts and cultures as well as creating a market for pottery.  Potters by 1912 were in residence at the museum, building pots, painting, and firing to educate the public. Museum supporters Vera Von Blumenthal and Rose Dougan provided the formula and finances to create the Pueblo Pottery Project. Both were part of an increasingly large community of people who were reacting against industrialized society, especially its impersonal nature and dehumanizing consequences. They believed that human creativity was an inherent, natural talent and was being destroyed at the expense of industrialization. Moreover, factory work was viewed as dehumanizing, devoid of human creativity.  The preservation of handcrafted objects, especially those made by preindustrial or \"primitive\" society, was perceived as critical to keeping the human creative spirit alive.\r\n \r\nIn 1917 or 1918, Dougan and Von Blumenthal built a home at the foot of Tsankawi Mesa (now part of the detached Otowi section of Bandelier National Monument). San Ildefonso was chosen for the women's experiment in revitalizing Pueblo pottery because of its proximity to their summer home. Within three years, Dougan and Von Blumenthal found their work had made but little impression on pottery production at San Ildefonso, and thus in 1919 they turned over $200 to the Museum to supervise the project.\r\n  \r\nCurator Kenneth Chapman and Wesley Bradley intended to go to the villages to buy pottery but they never had the chance. During the winter and spring of 1919-1920 they had the opportunity to spend all of the money in Santa Fe. Chapman wrote, “Julian and Maria Martinez of San Ildefonso appeared with a wagon load of their pottery…. Here was an unexpected problem. They were the last we would have picked for our experiment, for they were accomplished crafts workers who might resent our suggestions toward improvement of their wares.” Maria and Julian were the best potters from their village, had demonstrated at the museum, travelled to world’s fairs in St. Louis and San Diego, and worked with a variety of anthropologists during archaeological excavations. Chapman chose four unusually well formed and finished pieces from their stock and paid twenty-five percent more than Maria and Julian asked. From Tonita Roybal, selling her wares door to door, he purchased one pot from her of an exceptional shape (Postma item #2043-xx?) paying her fifty-percent more. The greater part of the fund was used to purchase pottery during the early months of 1920 before the opening of the tourist season, and most of the resulting purchases were being sold to other museums and to summer visitors (Chapman 1978:29).  \r\n\r\nBruce Bernstein; Coe Foundation for the Arts\r\nSanta Fe, NM; 2015\r\n\r\nKenneth Chapman, Unpublished Memoirs; Kenneth Chapman Papers; School of Advanced Research; Santa Fe, NM.. \r\n\r\nSchaal, polychroom beschilderd met abstracte vruchtbaarheidsmotieven. SAN ILDEFONSO. San Ildefonso kent een lange aardewerktraditie. Het hedendaags aardewerk ontwikkelde zich uit Powhoge polychroom, maar zwart-op-wit decoraties verdrongen het polychroom geleidelijk, zodat dit product de periode 1890-1920 typeert.\r\n\r\nHet aardewerk van San Ildefonso trok publieke aandacht door het werk van Maria Martinez (1887-1980) en haar echtgenoot Julian (1885-1943). Maria demonstraarde haar kunnen in 1904 op de Louisi-ana Purcha-se Exposition. Daarna werkten zij en Julian voor de Fred Harvey Compa-ny die de hotels, restaurants en winkeltjes langs de AT&SF Railroad exploiteerde. In dat verband toonde zij haar werk op de Panama-California Expo-sition in San Diego in 1915. Korte tijd later ontving zij reisgezelschappen van Fred Harvey thuis. Hun aardewerk werd nog meer gewild toen zij in 1919 een nieuwe decoratietechniek ontwikkelden van mat zwarte decoraties op een zwart glanzende achtergrond.\r\n\r\nMaria werkte later samen met haar zoon Popovi Da (1921-1971) die het zwart-op-siena aardewerk ontwikkelde. Kleinzoon Tony Da (geb. 1940) volgde in de voetstappen van zijn vader en grootouders. Albert Dunlap en zijn echtgenote Josephine Cordova ontwikkelden ook een populaire stijl, de wit-op-rood variëteit.\r\n\r\nRose Gonzales (1900-1989) ontwikkelde aardewerk waarvan in het oppervlak figuren werden uitgesneden in bas-relief. Dit leerde zij ook haar zoon Tse-Pe. Dora Gachupin (geb. 1939) en haar man Tsepe (geb. 1940) kregen een aantal kinderen waarvan Jennifer, Irene, Gerri en Canda-ce followed in de voetstappen van hun ouders volgden. Het relief-snijden leerden zij van hun moeder die de nadruk blijft leggen op kwaliteit in plaats van kwaliteit. De enige concessie die aan de markt wordt gedaan is het formaat van hun vaatwerk.\r\n\r\nEen andere beroemde pottenbakster was Blue Corn die meerdere stijlen beheerste. In de jaren zestig maakte zij kleine zwart-op-zwarte potjes waarin Ronson-tafelaanstekers pasten, een populair artikel." .
