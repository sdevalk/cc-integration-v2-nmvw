The captain is aboard, while a crewman is shown on the beach beach sorting trepang (bêches-de-mer) prior to smoking them.\r\n\r\nFor perhaps three centuries, up to the first decade of the 20th century, Indonesian trepangers sailed to the Arnhem Land coast with the north-west winds at the onset of the Wet season. They would stay for about six months and then, at the beginning of the Dry when the south-east winds blew, they would return home.\r\n\r\nThey would fish for trepang, and collect tortoiseshell and pearlshell, sandalwood and other timbers. In exchange for supplying or helping to gather these goods, The Aborigines were paid by their visitors in tobacco, steel knives, rice, cloth, and - especially as a reward for the use of Aboriginal women - in liquor.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, the visits of the Macassans were inreasingly discouraged by the Australian athorities, by means of the imposition of various levies, and annual visits creased in 1908.\r\n\r\nLance Bennett" .
