<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/2d1b16c2b4dc348abd33ed3eaa551104> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Undertaken in a commission from 1999, Jungerman created a piece for the Volkenkunde Museum to be displayed on the external facade of the Volkenkunde building. This piece entitled “Confused Receivers” features the artists’ characteristic combination of organic symbols and forms, intertwined with images of the technology, modernity and everyday tools to create a dialogue about travel, displacement, and global Modernism.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n                The artist states: “The installation [Confused Receivers] explains the risk individuals have to undergo to become part of a different society. The form of the flattened toad is a perfect metaphor of human beings who took the decision to move, with the dish antennae the need is indicated which one has to have contact with the outside world so that one can develop their own code to exist in the new society. The existence of the house depends on the information from the outside world.” \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n                The piece features many of the artists frequently used iconographies, such as the flattened toad and satellite images. This combination of both highly symbolic elements tell through visual language a prevalently felt story of travel, migration, displacement. As well as the effect technology and communication have on integration into a space, a culture, or a place of belonging: home." .
