It forms part of the collection of objects from Southern Africa donated by Hendrik Muller to Museum Volkenkunde in 1931. These objects were collected by Muller in the period 1881-1883 when Muller visited what is now Zanzibar, Mozambique, and South Africa.\r\n\r\nMuller’s collection formed the basis for the 1892 book Industrie des Cafres du sud-est de l'Afrique which he wrote with Johannes François Snelleman a curator from Museum Volkenkunde. The book proved highly influential in shaping European understanding, and misconceptions, of the material culture of the region.\r\n\r\nLike many objects from Muller’s collection this spectacular table cloth which was made in Mozambique is a piece of tourist art created specifically for sale to Europeans. In 1892, Muller and Snelleman estimated that the object – which measured 160cm by 140cm excluding the fringe - is comprised of over 600,000 glass beads, not counting the fringe. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Muller does not state where exactly in Mozambique this object was made only that it was from the Zambezi-river region. This tablecloth uses seven different colours of imported Venetian beads arranged in repeating geometric patterns. The beads are strung together on threads and were then sewn onto a backing cotton cloth. The backing cloth does not extend to the fringe which is made out of both smaller and larger beads and tassels made from coloured textile." .
