<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/62131a7a11456a46879404efae4cfd44> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Jolotón is made of a glossy white rayon fabric of obviously commercial manufacture and in a novelty weave which approximates in a general way the texture of the combination gauze and plain weaving of the fine cotton jolotones. The rayon jolotón further imitates the handmade fabric jolotones in its seam construction (see 5946 - 86 / 92). It was made from a piece about 85 cm wide and 125 cm long with raw cut edges at either end and selvages on the sides. As it was half as long and twice as wide as the pieces of hand woven fabric, this jolotón was formed by folding top to bottom rather than end to end as with the other jolotones. With such an arrangement it is necessary to cut only the neck slit (19 cm). However, the material was slit clear across the top, the edges turned under, and the usual needlework applied in fuchsia thread following the old construction pattern. Another characteristic resulting from its being made from commercial cloth is that this jolotón tends to be narrower in proportion to its length than the others." .
