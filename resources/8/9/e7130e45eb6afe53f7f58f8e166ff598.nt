Versierd met parallelsgewijs ingesneden verticale groeven en dwarsgroeven die elkaar kruisen.  De ingesneden figuren hebben hun betekenis, men brengt daardoor bepaalde mededelingen over.\r\n\r\nDe ingesneden figuren hebben hun betekenis, men brent daardoor bepaalde mededelingen over.\r\n\r\nA short stick of light coloured wood, pair to 642.8, also with short 'tally grooves' or notches cut along the margins and sides, the longer and shorter cuts made on opposed margins. There are fourteen long grooves opposed to sixteen, and fourteen short ones opposed to fifteen. The longer cuts, steeper in section are across the width of the stick in both examples, the shorter cuts ('V'-shaped in section) produce a dentated edge down the side of the stick. It measures 8.5 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm. In both these examples the notches suggest that they were made with a metal tool rather than a stone adze or shell tool.\r\n\r\nThe pair of message sticks is a unique specimen. No other examples from this ara are known, and there is only one reference to their use in the local literature. Bray (1923:7) mentions that 'messages from tribe to tribe were carried verbally except very important ones. This [sic] were marked on a stick by means of notches'. To the south we have records of their use at Port Stephens (Scott 1929:33-4), but unfortunately no description of their features. To the north in Queensland such stick were used, and there are surviving examples in the Queensland Museum's collections. Some of these bear notches, as do the Richmond River specimens, though the particular examples do not come from south-east Queensland (see Hamlyn-Harris 1918:19, 20, 26, 27). Such message sticks apparently served a double purpose; they were 'memory sticks' for the bearer, and guarantees of his good faith as he travelled through the territory of different tribal groups. There seems to be little information on their use in eastern New South Wales, though they are reasonably well documented for other areas such as the Darling basin and central Australi (Hamlyn-Harris 1918; Howitt 1904:678-710)." .
