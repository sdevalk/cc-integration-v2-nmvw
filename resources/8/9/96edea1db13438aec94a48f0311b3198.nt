The upper part of the net has a loop through which a fibre drawstring is run. By pulling on the string the net may be closed tightly protecting its contents from insects.\r\n\r\nIt was donated to the museum by H.P.N. (Hendrik) Muller in 1886. At this time Muller had not yet visited Liberia, but his father's company, Hendrik Muller & co., had operated in Liberia since the 1860s." .
