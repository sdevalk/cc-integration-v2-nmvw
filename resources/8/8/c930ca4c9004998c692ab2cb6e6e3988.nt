It was the men's role to take care of the comfort of the family camp or village. Men also carved dugout canoes, brightly painted totem poles and the handles of ceremonial rattles. Canoes were the most important means of transportation in the south Florida swamps, rivers and bays. The bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) was the preferred tree for a dugout canoe in the Southeast. The shape of the canoe was roughened with an axe and later on hollowed out with an adze. The canoes had a pointed prow and a shallow draft so that they could sail with low tides and through the swamps of the Everglades. The canoes were usually decorated with bright colors and patterns that identified the owner of the canoe. Families with their trade and household goods could fit in a canoe for trips along the river. Sometimes a sail was added to make use of the prevailing southeast winds. Trains, cars and airboats replaced the canoe as the most important means of transportation. To the Seminoles and Miccosukees woodcarving has always remained a folk art or craft rather than a serious art form. Since 1918, men carve animal figures or other objects such as drums, decorated rattles and canoe models for tourists." .
