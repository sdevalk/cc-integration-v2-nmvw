He is shown during one of his famous high jumps. He is accompanied by Joe with boomerangs. The men's dance is much more individualistic than the women's dance. The men mostly dance in pairs (of brothers) and take turns after every item of this night's catfish and goanna songs. The boys start dancing as soon as the singers start rattling their boomeran- towards the end of a song item. No ordinary clapping sticks are used during this night." .
