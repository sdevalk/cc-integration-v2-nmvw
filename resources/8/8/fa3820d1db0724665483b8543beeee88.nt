In the mythological times a large group of Tingari Men camped at this site before continuing  their journey north-east to Lake Mackay. \r\nSince events associated with the Tingari Cycle are of a secret nature, no further detail was given. Generally, the Tingari are a group of mythical characters of the Dreaming who travelled over vast stretches of the country, performing rituals and creating and shaping particular sites. The Tingari men where usually followed by the Tingari Women and accompanied by novices and their travels and adventures are enshrined in a number of songs cycles.  These mythologies form part of the teachings of the post initiatory youths today as well as providing explanations for contemporary customs." .
