However, they also produced a variety of baskets for different purposes themselves. Most common were wicker baskets of simple structure and weave, and mostly lacking decoration. Willow (Salix) was the preferred material for these containers, but dogwood (Cornus) and rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus) were also used, often with the bark left on (Stevenson 1883:368-370; Mason 1904:500-503, plate 28,213; Tanner 1983:75-78; Whiteford 1988:158-167; Fane 1991:139-141). The rims of both are wrapped with yucca strands.\r\n362-151, 152, 153 Zuni basketry\r\n\tTen Kate's negative judgement of the quality of Zuni basketry was shared by his contemporary Colonel James Stevenson (1883:334) who collected 200 baskets at Zuni in 1879 and 1880 for the Smithsonian Institution. In a modern study, Andrew Hunter Whiteford (1988:158-163) concurs, albeit noting some rare exceptions, such as coiled baskets in the shape of small ollas with a two-rod-and-bundle foundation. The shallow wicker peach baskets in which decorative use is made of the light-colored rabbit brush and red willow to create a checkered pattern is also aesthetically pleasing (cf. Herold 2005:93-94,162).\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)" .
