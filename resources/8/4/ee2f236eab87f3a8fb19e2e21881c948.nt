<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/29ea84477d4ff10b998ffaf18ff19aaa> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Engelse tekst\r\nThis soup tureen is part of a service of 106 pieces purchased by Hendrik Swellengrebel (1700-1760), then governor of the Dutch Cape colony, ca. 1750 for 90 Spanish reales. Swellengrebel was the only governor of the Dutch Cape colony who had been born at the Cape. \r\n\r\nThis service is an example of gilded armorial Chinese export porcelain manufactured in China according to European tastes. Swellengrebel would have chosen the design from a stock pattern and then ordered the service with his family crest added. The family crest may be seen on both the lid and body of the tureen.\r\n\r\nServices of this style were popular at the Cape of Good Hope in the 18th century and is similar to other Cape services from the period. Only the wealthiest Cape burghers could afford such expensive luxuries. This particular service was likely exported via the Chinese port of Canton (Guangzhou) and arrived at the Cape only after Swellengrebel had left for the Netherlands in 1751. It was then sent to the Netherlands. Part of the service was destroyed in the Second World War while the rest of the service survives in a private collection." .
