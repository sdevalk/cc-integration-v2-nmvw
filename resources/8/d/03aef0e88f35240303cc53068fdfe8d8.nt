De vier karakters 'su', 'pok', 'kŏn' en 'hwa' zijn op de schede gegraveerd.\r\nSiermessen (changdo) werden gedragen door zowel mannen als vrouwen van alle klassen en bestaan in verschillende vormen en mate van decoratie. Mannen dragen het mes aan de riem of in een foedraal, vrouwen dragen het mes veelaal als deel van de norigae, de kledingdecoratie voor vrouwen. Deze messen hadden aanvankelijk een praktische functie, maar tijdens de Chosŏn-periode verworden ze tot decoratie, en op den duur worden zelfs modellen gemaakt die niet meer uit de schede gehaald kunnen worden.\r\nEenvoudige modellen worden aangeduid als ‘mappaegi’ en hevig gedecoreerde modellen als ‘kajŭnjangshik’. De mate van decoratie geeft de sociale status van de eigenaar aan. Verder kunnen deze messen opgedeeld worden naar vorm. Zo zijn er messen met een S-vorm (ook de vorm van het Chinese karakter ‘ŭl’; ŭltchado), en messen waarbij in de schede tevens eetstokjes gestoken kunnen worden (ch’ŏmsado). Andere verschillen doen zich voor in de vorm van de schede, die rond, vierkant, of achtkantig kan zijn.\r\nVanaf 1978 is de produktie van dit soort messen, die zich concentreert in Kwangyang in Chŏlla (zuidwest Korea), aangewezen als Belangrijk Immaterieel Cultureel Erfgoed (Chungyo Muhyŏng Munhwajae) nr. 60. Dit gebied is bekend om zijn lange geschiedenis wat betreft de fabricage van messen, hetgeen samenhangt met de aanwezigheid van ijzermijnen in die regio.\r\n\r\nThis knife called ŭnjangdo is composed basically of iron with silver as a secondary material. Primarily it consists of one blade with a handle, and a sheath which covers the blade. The flattened blade tapers down towards the end, shaping a parabolic curve, not sharply, but gradually, with one axis unchanged. The handle is shaped in a hexagonal form. On the other hand, the sheath is shaped in a rectangular form. Apart from making the inside of the sheath fit exactly to tapered blade, a craftsperson used a set of chosticks to join the two parts. \r\n\r\nIn a facet of the handle, four Chinese letters have been engraved.  They mean 'longevity, good fortune, good health, and peace' respectively.  At both facets around this facet, patterns of flowers and leaves have been engraved in symmetry. The other side of three facets has a crane and a turtle, which traditionally symbolise a happy and peaceful longevity. A tree has divided the background into two phases of the sky and the sea. Overall, this blade handle contains an imagined universe.  Every decoration has been made in symmetry, so even if there are too much engraving, it seems to have a simple design, denying unnecessary ornaments or superfulous expressions. Also it cannot be overemphasized that we can find designs of classical motifs including flowers, birds, trees, turtles, cranes, tigers, dragons, and bats in daily goods as well as in painting, literature, and songs in the late Choson dynasty. \r\n\r\nThese kinds of knives have been widely regarded as chest pendants of women of high rank in Choson dynasty. Particularly, silver was precious at that time, so it must have been used as a symbol of social standing. Pendants had mostly single ornament, but some consisted of triple ornaments. Some were only knife-shaped ambers without real blades.  In this respect, we can assume that silver knives lacked practical uses.\r\n\r\nHowever, chopsticks attached to these knives might indicate something different. We may see the roles of chopsticks as a tool when eating out, peeling fruits or cutting papers.  According to Kim Eun Young, a craftsperson of embroidery, an ornamental knife or a finger ring made with amber was also used for emergency medicine; when wounded suddenly, they scratched the amber and applied its dust on the wound as a hemostat.\r\n\r\nSome say that a set of silver chopsticks was used for testing poison in dishes. It was broadly regarded that silver chopsticks would turn black if they came into contact with poisoned food. It is now proved that silver had no reaction to arsenic or cyanide, but if rotten eggs, onions, or garlic were used, the hydrogen sulfide they released might cause the chopsticks to change colour.\r\n\r\nOriginally the skills of several main craftspeople were required to manufacture one item. Each highly specialised hand works made a sheath, a blade, a handle, and the engravings respectively, but now one craftsperson deals with twenty three processes at the same time. Also a knife blade in the past was made of magnetic sand of high density, but the decline of this technique resulted in rather simple processing of steel. According to Park, a piece of steel, heated to about 1,000 degrees Celsius, is dipped repeatedly in water mixed with yellow mud. The speed of moving the heated steel from furnace to water has much to do with the tempering of the finished blade. \r\n\r\nKnife-carrying customs are said to have been started when the Mongol invasions to the Koryo (918-1392) occurred in the thirteenth century and it became popular in the Choson period. According to existent documents, in 1498, the king promulgated the prohibition of luxuries. From then on, the commoners were prohibited to use a silver knife, but his regulation did not work very well. In result, later in 1670, people except the highest class who carried a silver knife, were warned to be arrested. \r\n\r\nOne document from the Choson period says that some women carried the knives as the last means to save themselves from 'falling from grace'during the Japanese invasion in 1684-1692. Even though there is no document that there knives were for attacking an assailant, likewise, we cannot conclude that every Choson woman carried a knife only to kill herself.\r\n\r\nWith a history dating back to the Three Kingdoms period (57 B.C. - A.D. 688), the knife industry continued until the turn of the 20th century, before the nation began to be open to industrialisation. Private artisans across the country produced knives adjusting the tastes of their aristocratic clients. The royal court also operated workshops to manufacture qualified knives to be used as gifts for courtiers. However, any details about distributions of workshops have not been found. \r\n\r\nThe art of making the traditional ornamental knives is best preserved today at Kwang-yang, a port city on the mid-south coast in South Cholla Province. This city brings the picture of a big factory of Pohang Iron and Steel Co., one of the world's largest steel mills, which was built on a man-made island off its coast. Kwang-yang has been famous for iron production since remote ancient times, since it has a rich reserve of magnetic sand.\r\n\r\nDecorative knives (changdo) come in a variety of shapes and levels of decoration and are worn by men and women of all classes. Men carry the knife on their belt or in a pouch, whereas women carry it on their belt or as part of the norigae. The knives originally had a practical function, but during the Chosŏn period they came to serve increasingly as decoration, to the point where some knives could not even be removed from the sheath.\r\nSimple models are referred to as ‘mappaegi’ and heavily decorated models as ‘kajŭnjangshik’, the level of decoration indicating the social status of the owner. Further distinction can be made according to shape, such as knives shaped in a curved s-shape (or the Chinese character ‘ŭl’; ŭltchado), or those with a pair of chopsticks attached to the sheath, called ‘ch’ŏmsado’. Further differences include the shape of the sheath, which can be round, square or octagonal.\r\nThe manufacture of these knives, which was designated as Important Intangible Cultural Property (Chungyo Muhyŏng Munhwajae) no. 60 in 1978, is centered around Kwangyang in Chŏlla province (South-West Korea). This area is famous for its long history of knife making, due perhaps to the presence of iron mines in that region." .
