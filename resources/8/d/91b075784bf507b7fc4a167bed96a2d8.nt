<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/bc5c9fd27162b59b75dcfbcbfd946a07> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This basket is made of construction of rattan skewers and rattan rings which are tied together with vine or palm leaves. \r\nIt has the form of a pear with a narrow opening at the top. A lid made of a rattan ring with plaited leaves is attached to the opening. It has a curved handle. \r\nIt was used for fishing small fish on the reef. It was probably mostly used by women, who put the basket in front of a stone in the shallow water, lifted the stone and drove the fish, who dwell under the stones, into the basket with a stick. \r\nMen and women use this basket for fishing crayfish. These dwell in rivers or near waterfalls in wholes on the ground. The crayfish are hauled out of the holes and driven into the basket with a stick." .
