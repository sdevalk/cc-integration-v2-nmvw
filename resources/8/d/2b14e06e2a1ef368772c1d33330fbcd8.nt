Lucy lived in this part of the desert as a young girl with her family and has an intimate knowledge and features and the plentiful supply of water and bush foods found here. In this painting we can see sand and hills, belts of dry ground, and a large soak water. Lucy also depicted a number of women by the soak filling their coolamons (wooden carrying bowls) with water to take bake to camp." .
