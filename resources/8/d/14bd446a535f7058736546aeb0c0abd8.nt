It belongs to the oldest collected artefacts of Marind culture. This particular piece has separate flat wings of which one is missing. The bottom is hollowed out to fit the performer's head. The top is decorated with abrus pips which are glued to the object by means of resin. Strings with halved coix seeds and several feathers hang from the edges of the wing. \r\nThe bower bird head ornament was worn by a batend dema (Doreh) performer during the ritual celebration connected with the re-enactment of some particular mythical episode. It is the Mahu-ze clan emblem representing a totemic ancestor corresponding to the wearer's clan affiliation. Its ritual significance and cultural symbolism are rooted in Marind mythology.\r\n\r\nThe dema-performer's \"face is concealed by a brightly coloured yellow shield representing a bower bird (batend)\" (Van Baal, 1966: 856) to which the feathers of cassowary and bird of paradise have been attached. \"The batend-shield is an ornament worn by most dema-performers\" (ibid.: 643), including the batend dema. \r\n\r\n\"Among the performers we note first a hais, then a stork, then four gari-bearers. Now a yam dema appears, adorned with representations of the vegetable symbolized by him. A pigeon and a cassowary follow. The latter runs up to another performer who carries an obyara-tree, the fruits of which are the favourite food of the cassowary. Then a batend-dema appears, guided by two iwag, his nakari. ...\" (Van Baal, 1966: 857).\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 20 november 2006" .
