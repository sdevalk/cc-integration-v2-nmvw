<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/f81ee1bddef599944dfc776039199309> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The sculpture ‘Composition’ by Padlaya Qiatsuk depicts a séance of a shaman drumming. He conjures is spirit-helpers, who can be seen around him in the shape of animals like seals and human face or mask. Again these are depicted at the side of the sculpture above each other. This composition is based on a long design and aesthetic Inuit tradition. Interesting to notice that also an inukshuk (formation of piled stones), the national symbol of Nunavut, is edited. Inukshuk were in former days landmarks in the landscape used for orientation. From earlier donations in the NMVW collection, there are some sculptures of shamans drumming, but only one of these is a composition of many aspects. This sculpture is therefore an important addition to the collection. See also one of the prints inth emuseum colection entitled “conjuring the spirits” (nr. RV-6094-217)." .
