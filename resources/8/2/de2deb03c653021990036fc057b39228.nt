In such cases these stones were treated as spiritual objects. They were painted, fed, and kept reverently in a bundle or bag. Their powers were addressed by prayer when needed, such as before a man went on a hunt or the war path, or when a woman was about to give birth. Sometimes shamans used such magic stones to lure buffalo before a communal hunt was staged, the latter use mentioned in Uhlenbeck's letter to the Leiden museum (RMV 1935; Hungry Wolf 1977:169-171; Scriver 1990:178-179; Dempsey 2001:606-607). The buffalo stone from the Uhlenbeck collection shows remains of red paint.\r\n(Pieter Hovens 2008)" .
