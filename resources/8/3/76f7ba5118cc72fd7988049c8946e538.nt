The deceased's bones are place into a hollow log which has been decorated with painted clan designs and ceremonially places into the ground where it remained until it slowly decayed over many years. \r\nThe log is made from a termite hollowed Stringybark tree (Eucalyptus tetradonta) and is decorated with totem emblems." .
