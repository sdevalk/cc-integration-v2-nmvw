<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1555-23> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Een netsuke in celluloid gegoten, met sporen van polychroom lakwerk, voorstellend Daruma, the founder of the Buddhist Zen-sect, seated in meditation, his hands folded.\r\n\r\nThis netsuke represents Daruma in a characteristic pose, quite often found in netsuke. For durther details, see 2602-681.\r\n\r\nThis netsuke, executed in celluloid - or possibly some other artificial material - and cast from a mold, intends to imitate similar netsuke made earlier in lacquer and especially in the so-called technique of negoro lacquerwork, consisting of a red lacquered base covered in black lacquer and then partially polished so that a nice effect of the colours is obtained.  It must be said, however, that it is not directly obvious whether this was actually intended as a fake. \r\nCf. 2602-681 for a similar netsuke in this technique." .
