<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/7e2c4c0e5672b0e99ead6d54da54ce4a> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The ladle is made of half a coconut shell and a wooden ladle. The hollowed out and smoothed coconut is parted in half (not necessarily evenly). A carved wooden ladle of different size and adornment is glued to the coconut. It is always attached in the inside. The manufacture was the work of the men, as is almost all carving  and wood work. \r\nDifferent kinds of adornments can be identified. They most probable don't have a special meaning, but are expression of the artist's creativity. Animal or human figures are probably an allusion to ancestral beings and totems. The handle is long and quadrangular. It is glued to the inside of the coconut with Parinarium. The upper end shows a crocodile's head. The crocodile is one of the most important ancestral beings which created the earth and everything that is on it today. It is naturally closely associated with the water, which is considered the most important of the primal elements and in which the dead souls and ancestral beings dwell. The crocodile therefore represents an earthly link to the second world of the spirits, with which people constantly try to interact.  \r\nJust above the rim of the coconut and again just underneath the head, there are carved-out cubes. The middle part in between is slightly bulgy. The whole handle has carvings all around, which are painted white and red. The coconut shell is painted red as well and it has dark lines from the upper rim to the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe ladle was used to scoop liquids and solid food from pots and kettles, often from a big wooden bowl. This was often done on feasts, to give out soup to guests. The ladles were kept in the house of the men and were sometimes a present to guests." .
