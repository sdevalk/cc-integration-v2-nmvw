<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1539-19> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Mountains and Rivers on the Kiso Road, Kisoji no yamakawa, from an untitled series on the theme of Snow, Moon and Flowers. Signed: Hiroshige hitsu, with seal: Bokurin shokoku, published by Okasawaya Taheiji, 1857/VIII.\r\nWoodblock print, oban triptych, 364 x 756\r\nRMV 1539-19\r\n\r\nThis impressive triptych composition is an adaptation of two plates illustrating the Magome Pass (801 m) in the Kisoji meisho zue guidebook (Vol. 3). Yet, it is difficult to make out whether the waterfall to the right is the ‘Male waterfall’, Otokotaki, or the ‘Female waterfall’, Onnataki – they are near each other in the plate, but Hiroshige apparently only incorporates only one in his design. The bridge to the left is indicated to be the Ohashi.\r\nThough generally considered to be part of a series of triptychs on the theme of Snow (this print), Moon (at Kanazawa), and Flowers (in shape of the whirlpools at Awa), another hypothesis is that this is the Winter subject from a series on the Four Seasons, with the Wirlpools as the Summer subject (1857/IV) and the Moon at Kanazawa (1857/VII) for the Autumn – unfinished, with the Spring theme lacking." .
