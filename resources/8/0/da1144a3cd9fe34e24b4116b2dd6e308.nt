<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7086-21> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "A loincloth type worn by a Sjaman. During their initiation the adepts prepare huge quantities of loincloth (kabit) from the tree bark of the breadfruit tree (Artocarpus) which they dye red by pounding and cooking the bark of the toggoro-mangrove tree with water, and soaking the cloth in the fluid with more water and salt for several days in a dugout canoe.\r\nThe shaman (kerei) holds the only specialized position to which a Mentawai man can accede. His ability to “see” and to communicate with souls and spirits is the magical result of a several months long initiation ceremony. This enables him to perform his multiple tasks in ritual and healing. Specific adornments are connected with his position, and others are peculiar to his wife who upkeeps together with him various taboos that are in force during his activities and seconds him in certain ritual tasks. She is also referred to as kerei." .
