The side is made from a thin board which is bent, with the overlapping ends sewn with vegetal fiber. The lashing consists of braided vegetal fiber. The sides are perforated with two round holes on opposite sides to \"let the sound out\" and tuning is done by heating the drum over a fire (cf. Densmore 1932: plate 26; Fabila 1940:227; Spicer 1980:108; 1983:259; Choate 1997:39, fig. 49; 45, fig. 62; 54, fig. 84). In relation to this drum Ten Kate noted the name of Luis Pangasi, probably the man who made it or the tampaleo from whom he obtained it.\r\n362-12, 56, 57, 58 Pascola artifacts\r\nThe Hispanicized Indian term pascola is derived from the Cahitan pahko o ola, meaning \"old man of the fiesta\" (Spicer 1940:174), and the term refers as well to the character as to the dance he performs. Masked ritual clowns have been a part of Yaqui ceremonials for many centuries, and later developed into the pascolas. They perform a variety of roles at different ceremonial occasions: as clowns, ceremonial hosts, and dancers at different occasions, including Easter festivities, and are central to Yaqui ethnic identity (e.g. Spicer 1940:182-189; 1954:76-77,183-184; Barker 1957). The dance is syncretistic, combining traditional Indian and Christian elements. Ten Kate's description of a Yaqui pascola performance, although rather short, is one of the earliest anthropological accounts of this dance that is performed annually during the season of Lent, shortly before Easter. The pascolas and their performances have drawn widespread interest as a multitude of publications testify, including several scientific studies from different perspectives (e.g. Bogan 1925; Spicer 1940:173-203; Painter 1986; Griffith and Molina 1980). Bronislaw Malinowski who was in Tucson in 1939 to consider a position with the University of Arizona's Anthropology Department, wrote a functionalist analysis of the Yaqui Easter Fiesta and the pascolas he saw perform at Old Pasqua Village (Troy 1998:178-180). In the 1930s an interdisciplinary group of researchers from Texas and Harvard University did fieldwork among the Sonora Yaquis and gathered a contemporary collection of artifacts for the Texas Technological College in Lubbock (now: Texas Tech University) and the Peabody Museum in Boston (Holden et.al. 1936:11).\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)\r\n\r\nLeren trommel, plat en ongeverfd; \"Luh√°ge\" ser. etiket.
