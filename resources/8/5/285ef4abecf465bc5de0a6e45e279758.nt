Basket making is a women's craft with specific rules designating which women are allowed to make a special kind of basket. For example, grandmothers or older women past menopause can make certain baskets to protect the power of the medicine. The traditional raw material for basketry in Louisiana is cane (Arundinaria tecta) but is has almost disappeared because of changing agricultural practices. Since 1920's the needles of the Longleaf Pine (Pinus palustrus) have proved to be a sufficient replacement of cane. At the same time, the raffia palm fiber (Raphia farinifera) substituted the elm inner-bark (Ulmus) which was used to stitch the coils together. Today practically all Koasati basketry is made of coiled pine needles with raffia. \tThis bag with handles is made of coiled pine needles sewn together with raffia This object is not a traditional design, but made to reach the demands of the tourist industry." .
