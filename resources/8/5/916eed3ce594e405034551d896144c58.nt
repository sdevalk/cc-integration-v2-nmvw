<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1485-327> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This wooden figure probably represents an ancestor or relative that recently died. It is carved from one piece of wood. Like all carving work, this was a man's job. \r\nIt shows a male person with long legs and big feet. The earlobes are big and hang down. The mouth is open and shows teeth. The hair is tied up the traditional way and stands up high. The figure wears a belt and a chest adornment. The arms and legs are adorned with plaits. Even the forehead and the hair are further decorated with carvings. All the adornment is coloured white and black, the rest of the figure is red. \r\nThe whole figure rests on a rectangular stud with which it could be stuck onto a roof beam. \r\nThe meaning of these figures is not quite clear apart from that they were always set up in men's houses. One can therefore assume that they represent deceased relatives or clan members. It is set up as a memory of the deceased rather than a resting place for its soul." .
