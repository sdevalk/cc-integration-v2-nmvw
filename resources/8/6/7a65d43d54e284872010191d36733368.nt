To avoid shogunate censorship, the authors set the play in the earlier Muromachi period (1333–1568) and the names of the characters were altered. However some names sounded similar and those with knowledge knew what they were referring to in reality. For example, the real person Ōishi Kuranosuke was changed to Ōboshi Yuranosuke. The play therefore fuses fiction and fact. \r\n\r\nThe central story concerns the daimyō En'ya Hangan, who is goaded into drawing his sword and striking a senior lord, Kō no Moronō (Note: although the furigana for Moronō's name is Moronao, the pronunciation is Moronō). Drawing one's sword in the shōgun's palace was a capital offense and so Hangan is ordered to commit seppuku, or ritual suicide by disembowelment. The ceremony is carried out with great formality and, with his dying breath, he makes clear to his chief retainer, Ōboshi Yuranosuke, that he wishes to be avenged upon Moronō. \r\n\r\nForty-seven of Hangan's now masterless samurai or rōnin bide their time. Yuranosuke in particular, appears to give himself over to a life of debauchery in Kyoto's Gion pleasure quarters in order to put the enemy off their guard. In fact, they make stealthy but meticulous preparations and, in the depths of winter, storm Moronō's Edo mansion and kill him. Aware, however, that this deed is itself an offense, the retainers then carry Moronō's head to the grave of their lord at Sengaku-ji temple in Edo, where they all commit seppuku. \r\n\r\nAct I, Tsurugaoka kabuto aratame (\"The Helmet Selection at Hachiman Shrine\") \r\nThis play has a unique opening, in which the curtain is pulled open slowly over several minutes, accompanied by forty-seven individual beats of the ki, one for each of the heroic rōnin. Gradually, the actors are revealed in front of the Hachiman Shrine in Kamakura slumped over like lifeless puppets. As the gidayū narrator speaks the name of each character he comes to life. Lord Moronō's evil nature is immediately demonstrated by his black robes and the furious mie pose which he strikes when his name is announced. He is hostile to the younger, inexperienced lords. They have all gathered to find and present a special helmet at the shrine and it is Hangan's wife, Kaoyo, who is the one to identify it. When the ceremony is over and he is eventually left alone with Kaoyo, Moronō propositions her but she rejects his amorous advances. \r\n\r\nZie: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chūshingura" .
