<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/9ddfb2dee9f75661921bd9e985081531> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Apache saddlebag; rawhide, cloth, metal tinklers, glass beads; l. (unfolded, incl. fringes) 190 cm., w. 30 cm.; ca. 1880.\r\n\tThis bag has red flannel cloth under parts of the overlay panels, which are further decorated with edgings of black and white glass seed beads, and small metal tinklers on short buckskin thongs. The serrated corner tabs have daubs of red paint on them as well as more tinklers. A few fringes on the body have large, opaque, light blue glass \"trade\" or \"padre\" beads knotted into them. The intermediate size of the bag and its use-wear again suggest it was used on a burro, or perhaps carried by a person. Construction and decoration are consistent with bags made by Chiricahuas and Western Apaches. This specimen was collected at San Carlos or Camp Apache, Arizona, in the summer of 1883.\r\n\tOne of the strengths of Ten Kate's Apache collection is his having collected four rawhide saddlebags, one each from the White Mountain Apaches, Chiricahuas, Mescaleros, and an Apache-made saddlebag from Navajos in New Mexico. Saddlebags made by many groups consist of a flat, elongate \"envelope\" with fringe on the short edges, folded in half across the rump of a horse, or over one's arm or shoulder. Saddlebags made by Plains groups generally have a slit opening along the folded edge of one of long edges, while saddlebags made by the Western Apaches and Chiricahuas have a longitudinal slit in the center of the top face of the \"envelope\" (Ferg 1987:fig. 5.48 and 8.11). This distinctive construction appears to be peculiar to these two groups, at least in the Southwest, but Feest (2006:78,96-97) has pointed out their similarity to slit pouches used by various tribes in the eastern U.S., and suggested that both may be derived from European predecessors, with Spaniards, of course, being the most probable source to have introduced the form to Apaches. There are a few virtually identical bags in various collections attributed to Mescalero and Jicarilla Apaches, but research to date has not precluded the possibility that they were received in trade from Chiricahuas or Western Apaches. Mescaleros and Jicarillas more typically made rawhide parfl√®ches. Navajos apparently did not make such saddlebags, although the construction of jish bags, made by medicine men to carry their paraphernalia, appears identical (Franciscan Fathers 1910:382; Frisbie 1987:fig. 4,7,10,13b; Kluckhohn et al. 1971:333-336). The saddlebags collected by Ten Kate from Mescaleros and Navajos in New Mexico possess no attributes that distinguish them from known Chiricahua and Western Apache saddlebags, and we suggest that those are probably the groups that actually made those bags. We know that various items made by Apaches in Arizona got traded long distances, including a beautiful Western Apache or Chiricahua rawhide saddlebag collected at the Sioux Agency in 1888 (Vincent et al. 2000:246).\r\n\tAll four of Ten Kate's saddlebags are made of a folded piece of rawhide for the body, with panels of rawhide overlay with elaborate geometric designs cut out of them. There may be a piece of red, black or blue cloth under the overlay to accentuate the cut-out designs. Rawhide corner tabs are serrated and sometimes perforated. Fringes are rawhide or buckskin. Assembly of nineteenth-century bags was usually done with sinew or buckskin thongs.\r\nWhile, in pre-reservation days, lost horses could be replaced by stealing more, horses were certainly considered valuable, and all Apache groups cared for their horses, making a variety of horsegear, usually modeled on Spanish and Mexican equipment. Considerable effort could be lavished on saddles, wooden spurs, quirts, ropes, rawhide horseshoes, tack and saddlebags, and Ten Kate collected several of such artifacts: four saddlebags from different groups, rawhide horseshoes or boots at San Carlos, Mescalero stirrups, and a rawhide rope and two quirts (horse whips) which may be either Apache or Navajo, but are listed as Apache in the Leiden inventory, based on Ten Kate's notes. All of these articles, as well as simple rawhide hobbles, were undoubtedly made on similar patterns by several Southwestern groups, and it is often impossible to know if examples obtained from a group were made by them, or obtained in trade from another. The horseshoes are of a simple style known to have been made by several Apache groups, Navajos, and various Puebloan tribes, all of whom almost certainly were copying those used by early Spanish explorers (Clark 1963:246). The stirrups and rawhide rope are both known to have been made by various Southwestern groups, and Ten Kate (2004:206,244) specifically mentions stirrups for both the Apaches and Navajos. And again, the braided leather, and braided horsehair, quirts are known to have been made by various groups, but their specific origin is uncertain. The importance of the two specimens collected by Ten Kate, regardless of which group made them, is that they document that both techniques were fully known and in use in 1883; braiding of horsehair hatbands and curios among Western Apaches may be a later introduction (Ferg 1987:99,102).\r\nTen Kate scorned romantic novelists' notions of the Apaches possessing splendid horses, and was unimpressed by the animals he observed at San Carlos. They were of small but robust stature, bred for physical endurance, and appeared poorly cared for. Riders seemed to have little regard for their mounts and often rode them to death on raiding expeditions when spare animals were also taken along, making them move swiftly over large distances. Ten Kate did not think the Apaches were very good riders, and remarked that their wooden stirrups were short and thus rode with their knees drawn up. Ten Kate found the riding style of the Apaches inelegant, with their trunks and heads in perpetual motion, and their arms flapping up and down their bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZadeltassen waren noodzakelijk voor het vervoeren van voedsel en persoonlijk bezit. Leren zadeltassen die met een leren touw werden dichtgebonden werden gebruikt voor het transporteren van geoogst voedsel zoals eikels, zaden, knollen, e.d. Daarnaast werden grote platte zadeltassen gemaakt die werden versierd, een statussymbool voor de ruiter. Deze hingen aan weerszijden van het zadel. De versiering bestond uit gekartelde randen, brede en smalle leren franje, ook vaak gekarteld, en driehoekige ingesneden gaten waarachter rode stof werd gezet, hetgeen een esthetisch mooi effect opleverde. Kleinere zadeltassen werden voor muildieren gebruikt. De zadeltassen werden gemaakt van het leer van bisons en edelherten, laten ook van koeienleer." .
