Aan de einden gevlochten bindkoorden.\r\n\r\nThis head ornament was a war dress in Humboldt Bay and Lake Sentani. Sande saw it worn when the men of Tobati and Ingras were to hold ‘’a contest in archery’’.  It was found with several others in one of the ''watch-houses'' in Asei. \r\nHead dress made mainly with cassowary feathers are also worn almost everywhere in New Guinea. It testifies to the importance of this bird in the whole island.\r\nOrnaments participate in highlighting the body and give value to men and women wearing them. Yet in daily life, clothes and ornaments are very simple. However, when social conditions are combined, and almost always during a public meeting outside of the village the situation changes. It is a matter of showing signs linked with the social membership, taking care of one’s appearance and exposing a part of the wealth acquired by exchanges. \r\nThe cassowary was taboo to the men of Humboldt Bay and Lake Sentani who had been initiated into the secret rituals: none of them would kill or eat it. \r\nThe cassowary was identified with the uaropo (the spirit of the men's house) who devoured the boys and afterwards gave them back as a man. \r\nAt the time of the festival for the novices, when the flutes were played, sticks decorated with cassowary feathers were thrust out through the palm-leaf roof and waved about, as a visible demonstration of the deadly game played by the uaropo.\r\nOften the flutes which produced the urapo voice were also ornamented with cassowary feathers." .
