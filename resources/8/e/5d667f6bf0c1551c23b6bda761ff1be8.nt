<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-645-9> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The ladle is made of half a coconut shell and a wooden ladle. The hollowed out and smoothed coconut is parted in half (not necessarily evenly). A carved wooden ladle of different size and adornment is glued to the coconut. It is always attached in the inside. The manufacture was the work of the men, as is almost all carving  and wood work. \r\nDifferent kinds of adornments can be identified. They most probably don't have a special meaning, but are expression of the artist's creativity. Animal or human figures are probably an allusion to ancestral beings and totems. \r\nThe handle is a flat board, parallel to the rim of the shell and has an openwork pattern. It is divided in three parts, which are each separated by a horizontal bar. The middle part is the broadest. It is tapered towards the end of the handle in the coconut shell. \r\nThe ladle was used to scoop liquids and solid food from pots and kettles, often from a big wooden bowl. This was often done on feasts, to give out soup to guests. The ladles were kept in the house of the men and were sometimes a present to guests." .
