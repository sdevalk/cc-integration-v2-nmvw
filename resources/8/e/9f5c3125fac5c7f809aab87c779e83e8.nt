<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/2fd4bf33c38b274ad1ea5da31e642525> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Drawstring pouch; Mohawk; ca. 1775-1825\r\nHide, walnut dye, porcupine quills, pigments; 40 x 13.5 cm.\r\nRMV 330-7; purchased in 1882 from Henry Nott Moseley\r\n\r\nBags with drawstring closures at the top and panels of ornamentation at the bottom are found in the earliest collections made in the Great Lakes region of North America.  The oldest were collected in New France between the early sixteenth century and 1759. Most are made of undyed hide painted with geometric motifs and have panels of netted quillwork suspended from the bottom. When the drawstrings of such bags are pulled tight, a clear resemblance can be seen to bags seen in the drawings of the Codex Canadensis made by the Jesuit Father Louis Nicholas between 1667 and 1670 during his service in missions on the south shore of Lake Superior and central New York state.  These missions were frequented by Ojibwe, Odawa, Mascouten (Kickapoo), Eastern Sioux and Mohawk and Oneida, two of the six nations of the Iroquois confederacy. As François Marc Gagnon (2011:75) has shown, Nicholas was particularly admiring of the skill and artistry of pouches, belts and other ornaments and paid them particular attention. \r\n\r\nThe drawstring bag purchased for the Museum Volkenkunde from the eminent British naturalist Henry Nottidge Moseley in 1882 is a descendant of these early bags. It is probably considerably older than this date, and likely purchased on the antiquities market either in England or in Halifax, Nova Scotia or Montreal during Moseley's two Canadian trips in 1873 and 1884. Other drawstring bags preserved in the Landesmuseum in Braunschweig (VM7251) the Museum fur Völkerkunde in Vienna (266), the Peter the Great Museum of Ethnology in St. Petersburg (1900.04), the National Museum of Ireland (N.N. 1298), and the British Museum (1921.10.14.100), resemble the Leiden bag even more closely. All share the deep brown or black color Aboriginal women produced with a walnut bark dye that had become popular in the mid- eighteenth century, and all display elaborate porcupine quill embroidery on both sides.  Only the bag in Braunschweig is securely documented, having been collected by August Wilhelm Du Roi during his regiment's service under the British in the American Revolution. We know from his memoir that he spent three months in Quebec City prior to participating in the failed British campaign into eastern New York State (Du Roi 1911). He could have acquired his bag from the Wendat at Quebec City during a three month stay in 1777 or from Iroquois during the campaign into the territory of the Mohawk, one of the six nations of the Iroquois confederacy, that followed. A Mohawk origin is further suggested by the bag in St. Petersburg. Although undocumented, it was part of a collection transferred from the Russian Geographical Society together that displays many late eighteenth-century Mohawk traits. To further complicate the problem of attribution, however, the fringed edge of the Leiden bag is closest to the Huron-Wendat bag in the Canadian Museum of Civilization. However, the design and iconographic resemblances to quill-worked Iroquois moccasins and to the linear style of beadwork with which Iroquois women gradually replaced quillwork, tip the balance toward a Mohawk attribution for the Leiden bag. \r\n\r\nThe iconography displayed by all these bags is informed by cosmological beliefs widely shared across the northeast and Great Lakes that centre on the generative power of the sun and the winds the blow from the four cardinal directions. In graphic art, the division of the design space into four equal quarters expresses this cosmology by large central cross and circle motifs and by the bilateral and quadrilateral symmetries of design that result. Similarly, a division into three parallel zones expresses the distribution of spiritual powers humans must access into the three zones of sky, earth and under-the-earth. Other motifs, such as lozenges ending in hooks or curls and serpentine motifs probably represent these beings. The mapping of these forces and powers artistically on one's personal possessions was a critically important means of orienting oneself in the world and of retaining the blessings of power gained from these other-than-beings through dreams. \r\n\r\n \r\nRuth B.
