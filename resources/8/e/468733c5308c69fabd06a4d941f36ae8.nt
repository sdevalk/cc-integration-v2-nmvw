It has a rectangularly shaped piece in the centre, which sticks out to help placing the stick on the shoulders. Both ends are shaped like a pyramid and are decorated with carvings that represent animal heads and figures. The tips are pointy. The wood is coloured red, the carvings black. \r\nThe sticks were used by women of the mountain area to carry water containers made of coconuts. Bundles of these water containers were hung on both ends of the stick which was placed on the shoulder. \r\n\r\nThese sticks were probably exclusively used on Lou island." .
