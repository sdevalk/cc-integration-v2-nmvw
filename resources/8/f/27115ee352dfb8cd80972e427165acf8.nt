<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/71ca701cbd92e7c1d20c0de40543ab3d> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The late nineteenth century saw an escalation of German engagement in Micronesia. The visits of merchant ships, together with ambitious approaches to collecting on the part of German museums, led to extensive acquisitions of older artefacts over the period, but also prompted islanders to produce new work. Ethnographic artefacts became economically significant exports trom colonial territories. Certain traders became well-established as middlemen, and back in Europe, museums sought not only to build their own collections, but to engage in exchanges with, and even sell artefacts on to, other museums. In response, on many islands such as Yap, carvers began to produce work for sale. Buyers were mainly middlemen seeking artefacts for these European markets, rather than travellers purchasing souvenirs. The works created included small figures of local men and women, often bearing tattoo designs and articles of dress. or in dance positions. Yapese were also prompted to replresent white men, who must still at this time have appeared odd and exotic. Whether these figures were produced mainly lor their own amusement or for sale is difficult now to ascertain.\r\n\r\n(Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts, p.307)" .
