De buitenrand van de korte zijden is voorzien een dubbele laag latten. De decoratie wordt gevormd door het karakter 'h≈≠i' (vreugde) omgeven door een rechthoekig meanderpatroon. Voorts zijn aan beide korte zijden drie banen aangebracht.\r\n\r\nBamboo mats as well as blinds have been a staple of everyday Korean life since the Choson period. On this floor mat, Chinese letters, hui, symbolising joy appear in the middle with geometic patterns outside. \r\n\r\nThe finest bamboo mats are made of thread-like bamboo strips. A special bamboo, known as shinudae or shikdae, is used because it is especially tender and does not break in the splitting process. It is also remarkably even in breadth from top to bottom, providing a sense of balance and facilitating the weaving-in of designs. Common bamboo called chamdae is known for its sturdiness but it is difficult to cut and its joints are thick. \r\n\r\nTamyang-gun County in Chollanamdo Province has been famous for the production of all kinds of bamboo products, especially bamboo blinds and floor mats. In fact, all the talented bamboo artisans have come from this area. \r\n\r\nAccording to a bamboo craftsman from Inam-ri in Tamyang-gun, it takes ten days to make one product. First he cuts the bamboo into even lengths. Then he divides the core from the outer layer and splits the outer layer into hundreds of thin strips. These strips are pulled through a small hole five times to guarantee uniform thickness and flexibility. They are then woven into curtains on standing looms. Once the weaving is finished, the craftsman trims the ends of the bamboo strips and applies a colorful fabric braid around the edge." .
