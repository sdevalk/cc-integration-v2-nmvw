The coconut is freed from all outer hair and then smoothed. A bamboo cane is glued to the small opening on the top  and serves as a bottleneck. Some parts of the coconut and the neck are coated in Parinarium putty. This coat has engravings, which are painted white and red. The manufacture was the work of men. \r\nThe vessel serves as water container and as a bottle to pour water." .
