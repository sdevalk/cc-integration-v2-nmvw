These long earrings are elegant statements of style, and part of the range of shell and bead jewellery known throughout California.\r\nShells harvested in California and on the West coast of America are important elements of Indigenous American jewellery traditions, with materials traded inland, such as the spiney oyster shell, which is an important component of Pueblo jewellery in New Mexico." .
