Manillas were bronze ingots fashioned into the shape of armbands and were used as trade goods. Copper and bronze were highly valued trade goods in West Africa long before the arrival of European merchants. Starting in the 15th century, European merchants began to manufacture their own manillas and exchange them for West African goods. Manillas were initially introduced by the Portuguese, but later Dutch, English, and French merchants also engaged in trade with manillas. \r\n\r\nWith the establishment of the Atlantic Slave Trade, manillas became one of the of the main currencies used to purchase enslaved human beings. England and the Netherlands eventually became the main manufacturers of manillas. Ships would depart from Europe loaded with manillas and other trade goods which were exchanged either for enslaved Africans who were then taken to the Americas aboard slave ships, or for raw materials which were taken to Europe.\r\n\r\nThe use of manillas as trade goods continued after the abolition of the Atlantic Slave Trade in the early 19th century. This manilla dates from that period, and was likely made in the early- to mid-19th century. In this period, manillas continued to used as trade goods which exchanged for West African products including ivory and gold, or were used in the illegal slave trade which persisted some decades after the official abolition of the Atlantic Slave Trade. This manilla was collected by the Frisian collector Joas Hiddes Halbertsma. He likely collected it in England. Museum records indicate that this manilla was made in Manchester for use in the trade with the Ashanti in present day Ghana." .
