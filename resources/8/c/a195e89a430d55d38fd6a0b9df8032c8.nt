<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/8b0fe97e37248becddf2b6acb069b6ed> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "“Kwei Star pointing to the Big Dipper ” (kui xing dian dou tu 魁星点斗图)\r\n\r\nKwei Star(Chinese, kui xing), is the first star of the Northern Dipper(Throughout eastern Asia, the constellation of  Big Dipper is called as the Northern Dipper. ) They are colloquially named \"The Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper\" (Chinese: 北斗七星; pinyin: bei dou qi xing). According to another saying, it is way to call the combination of the first four stars of Big Dipper. In ancient Chinese legend, Kwei star is the god who controls the luck in literature and official exams so that he also rules the scholar prestige and official ranks. Ancient Chinese literati own much respect to this god and in many regions of China, “pavilions of Kwei Star” were built and are still seen nowadays. \r\nTwo Chinese characters can be used for “kui” (魁and奎)in “kuixing”, both of which mean “first”, “chief”, or “head”. The character “魁(kui)” is composed of two parts which have their meanings by own---the character of the left part means “ghost” and the right one, “Chinese peck”, a kind of ancient recipient for drinking, it’s hard to say from when, but it’s sure that the explanation of  “魁(kui)” as “ghost  looting Chinese peck” according to the form of the character “魁(kui)”  had been spread amongst folks in ancient China, so the image of Kwei Star started to be depicted like this: an ugly and ferocious ghost is raising one of his legs on purpose of reaching the Northern Dipper. This image is represented quite a lot in Chinese folk arts.\r\nThis rubbing is made from the inscription of  “kwei Star pointing to the Big Dipper ” , painted by Ma Dezhao of late Qing Dynasty. The original painting is inscribed on a stele which is conserved in the famous Xi’an Beilin (now it is reconstructed into the Beilin Museum in Xi’an).\r\nThe image of Kwei Star in Ma’s painting turns out to be more creative than many others of the same theme. The painter blended the characteristic of painting and calligraphy together. He painted a figure of a ghost with the form of the character “鬼(gui)” on the left and wrote a big “斗(dou)” on the very upper right. Standing  with his right leg on a big character called “鳌(ao)” which means the first rank in the official exam and raising his left leg, Kwei Star holds an inkstone with left hand, raises his right hand with a brush and turns back his head to look at the big “斗”. All the image is evidently showing us the meaning of a well-know saying in ancient China: “:奎星点斗,独占鳌头(kui xing dian dou, dui zhan ao tou)”, which means having good luck in the official exam and got a good ranking. Moreover, the body of Kwei  Star can be also divided into eight characters “正心修身,克己复礼(zheng xin xiu shen, ke ji fu li)”, which is the norm of Confucianism for self-development of a person.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dipper\r\nhttp://www.zdic.net/zd/zi/ZdicE9ZdicADZdic81.htm\r\nhttp://9822629.s31.sqnet.cn/book.asp?id=519\r\n\r\n(Jing Tan, 2008)" .
