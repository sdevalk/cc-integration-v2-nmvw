Religieuze volksschildering, voorstellend drie onsterfelijken, sŏnin, met een hert en een leerling. De persoon die het hert vasthoudt is mogelijk Zhang Guolao (Kor.: Chang Kwa-no), herkenbaar aan de bamboe fluit (yuku) die tevens als wandelstok dient. De figuur achter Zhang is waarschijnlijk Lu Dongbin (Kor.: Yŏ Tong-pyŏn), te herkennen aan het toverzwaard dat hij ontving voor het doorstaan van de zogeheten tien verleidingen.\r\nOp de achterkant van het papier staat in een hoek met inkt het Chinese karakter voor '5'.\r\n\r\nThe figure who holds a deer is probably Zhang Guolao (Chang Kwa-no in Korean pronunciation) who has the yuku, bamboo cane in his hands. Zhang Guolao was said to have lived between the 7th and 8th centuries and had the power to render himself invisible. His walking cane, yuku was believed to be a musical wind instrument.  Zhang lives in seclusion on mount Zhong Tiao. During the Tang dynasty, he was already reported to be over 200 years. Once, the Empress Wu Zhe Tiang dispatched officers to call upon him and bring him back for questioning, but he pretended to be dead. Afterwards some people met him walking around Mount Heng. He was invited by Xuan Zong, the Emperor of the Tang dynasty, to demonstrate his magic arts. He typically is pictured riding a white donkey with his back forward. The donkey is capable of running thousands of miles each day. According to the legend, when he needs to rest, he folds up the white donkey and hides it in a small box. \r\nLu Dong Bin (Yŏ Tong-pyŏng in Korean pronunciation) behind Zhang is a scholar type immortal. When he was young, he tried twice but could not pass the highest imperial examination. When he was sixty-four years old, thanks to Han Zhong Li, he became an immortal. It is said that he now lives in Mount Zhong Lan to cultivate himself according to the religious doctrines of Daoism. He beheaded a flood dragon. He often plays with a crane and drinks copious amounts of wine. He was granted a magic sword as a reward for overcoming ten temptations. This sword is his trademark. \r\nWhen Korea entered the Chosŏn Dynasty, its ambassadors were sent to China to learn Daoist Fasts and Offerings rituals. Cheng Emperor of the Ming Dynasty sent persons specially assigned for taking 600 kinds of Daoist moral tracts to Korea. Because a Daoist organization was not formed in Korea, it vanished into folk beliefs or other religious beliefs (Heavenly Daoism). \r\nDaoist (Taoist) immortals are considered 'patron saints' of the Daoist belief. Their images were representative of typical individuals and represented wealth and poverty, old age, and youth, male and female. It was believed that ordinary human beings could learn the sectets of nature and become immortal, through hard study. These immortals were idolised and respected for their wisdom, humour, and moral lessons. Normally, only eight immortals are officially recognised, but legends describe several more. As the Eight Daoist Immortals to which they belong, these emblems are representations of longevity." .
