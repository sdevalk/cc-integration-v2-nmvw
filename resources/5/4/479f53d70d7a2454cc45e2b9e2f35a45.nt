Het roer is vervaardigd uit één in de lengte doorboord stuk hout. Aan één zijde, waar zich kennelijk de kop bevond, zijn resten van vezel op het hout te zien. het andere einde vertoont geen sporen van een los mondstuk.\r\n\r\nTobacco was introduced to Korea from Japan in 1618. A gisaeng, female entertainer, or upper class person smoked a long pipe, while a middle-aged man used a medium length pipe and a young man or a servant used a short length pipe. The common people would not smoke in front of an elder or a high-born person. A pipe made of black copper with an etched silver inlaid mouthpiece was the favorite of the common man. A tobacco bag and pouch holding fire-making tools such as flint, a piece of metal and dry wood were carried by travellers, with a long pipe in a belt tied around the waist.\r\n\r\nThe reason bamboo was uniquely used as material is related to the belief system in the late Choson society. Bamboo is one of \"the four gentlemen\", personalised characters who are exclusive members in a form of Korean classical art. (The rest of three gentlemen are plum, orchid and chrysanthemum.) Four of these depict a certain aspect and principle of Confucianism, the intellectual and moral foundation of Korean culture. The principle which the bamboo embodies is the straight and firm rectitude of a Confucian scholar. The straight stalk signifies fidelity to one's principles, and its hollow center denotes humility. In the words of one Confucian scholar, the bamboo, which is neither tree nor grass, avoids the extremes of both tree and grass, and roots itself in the moderation of the golden mean. It is firm like a tree, yet yielding like grass. One classical poet, therefore, said that he might be able to manage without his favorite dish a long time, but he could not survive even a moment without beholding this bamboo pipe. No artificial benting and hollowing is needed for this bamboo to function as a pipe. \r\n\r\nConcerning the question why Korean pipes were long, the culture respecting the elderly could be an answer.  It is said that there was no greater joy than sitting at home in one's room, as the elderly will, and spending some time with a changjuk. When it was for the elderly man, he did not have to stir to use the ashtray over there across a room. With his bamboo conductor's baton he could instruct his servant to fetch it. And he had his scepter to brandish for instilling in mannerless youth some respect for authority. \r\n \r\nThere is yet another answer for its length. It is said that a long pipe improves the quality of the smoke. A bamboo pipe's long stalk gives the smoke time to cool off and drop its bite. And long before modern medicine ever discovered the harmful effects of nicotine Koreans were eliminating it on its way up through that long stalk." .
