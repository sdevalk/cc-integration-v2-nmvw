<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7223-1> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Jésus Malverde (1870-1909) is internationally known for being a notable 'narcotraficante' (drug trafficker). He used to be criminalized during the early 20th century, but is now considered a saint worldwide. He is often iconized because of his Robin Hood-alike reputation; he stole from the rich and shared his loot with the poor. Nowadays, he is known for being the patron of  'narcotraficantes' and is worshipped on altars. Drug traffickers often pray to Malverde for protection during their smuggling efforts." .
