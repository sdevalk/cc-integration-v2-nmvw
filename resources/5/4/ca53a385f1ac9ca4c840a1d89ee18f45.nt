Skookum dolls were popular from the early 1920s until the 1960s. They were factory made dolls that resembled Native American people. They were sold to the tourists at trading posts in the Western United States. Early dolls heads were made of dried apples with the bodies made of wood and stuffed with either leaves, straw, twigs or grass stuffed in a muslin sack. Later the dolls were made from composition and had mohair wigs. Later dolls were made of plastic and had plastic brown shoes. They have \"Indian style\" blankets as part of their attire. Some had jewelry such as beaded necklaces or earrings. Some dolls have feathered head dresses. The sizes of the dolls ranged from babies inside of cradle boards to large, human size store display dolls. The general rule of thumb is the larger the doll, the more valuable/rare they are. The most common sizes range from about seven inches to about 12 inches tall. Skookums were widely imitated. Minnetonka, Milbros or Minnehaha dolls are similar but not the same. Most Skookum dolls were made so they look to the right. Skookums do not have arms - they are wrapped with blankets and have the suggestion of arms. Skookums never have gray hair as in \"elders\". Skookums should have the words \"Skookum\" either stamped on their brown plastic shoes or a tag with \"Skookum\" on their foot in the case of the older versions (source\"Wikipedia)." .
