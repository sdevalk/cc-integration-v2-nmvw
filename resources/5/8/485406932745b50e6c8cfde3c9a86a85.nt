On the left hand side, we see a depiction of the goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. She is recognisable because she is dropping gold coins out of her hand. On the right hand side, we see the god Ganesha, holding a bowl full of the Indian sweet dessert known as laddoo. The combination of these two deities in this poster indicate that it is related to the festival of divali, which takes place in the month of November. Diwali is considered a particularly auspicious time to take on new challenges, and Hindus will often pray to Lakshmi for wealth or blessings, and to Ganesha, who is said to remove obstacles." .
