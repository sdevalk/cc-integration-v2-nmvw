<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/df7a2ea6998cd940ce7ad8beb8fff28a> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Woodcut print `Trading Views #5' (1st series) made by Jacob Meders between the 2nd and 28th of February 2020 on the occasion of his artist fellowship at the National Museum of World Cultures, in response to works by Theodoor de Bry regarding early contact of North America.\r\n\r\nThis series of five woodcut prints is made within the larger framewordk of the series `Divided Lines' developed by Meders which speaks to the nature of the entanglement both in terms of image and in terms of heritage of European and indigenous North Americans. The series is directly inspired by the book plates that Meders was able to research and consult in the Special Collections Department of the Leiden University Libraries. These early representations in maps and books show how early European contact generation images of indigenous North America, but then were reproduced and became settled aspects of European imagination, influential understandings down the century.  These images reside with us still, both as historical artefacts and as packages of understanding.\r\n\r\nThe work is a piece in five parts.\r\nThe central image shows a round house, the traditional ceremonial centre used by Californian indigenous peoples as a gathering space, the smoke rising out is aesthetically pleasing and shows activity within. The two oak trees contain an acorn and a basket. This represents both the sustenance provided by traditional foods of Native California and the importance of the basket which was one of the highest art forms coming out of California as well as the means of cooking acorn, as leached acorns were cooked as mush in baskets through the addition of very hot stones. Baskets become watertight when wet. This woodblock print is about presence but also absence. Native Californian homelands were lush, but the colonial history is late, and in the middle of the 19th century extremely violent, due to the aggressive settlement that happened during the goldrush. The central image is therefore a place of rest, and community, flanked by other images that speak to visual culture, representation and conflict. \r\n\r\nFlanking this central image are found smaller woodblock prints. The lower two are male figures inspired by 16th and 17th century prints of indigenous Americans and Europeans, with a mix set of reference, from Virginia and Florida, so British and Spanish colonialists. Here the upper torso and lower body are mixed references, showing the joint legacy of America. \r\n\r\nThe smaller prints at the top right and left hand corners, have mischievious cherubs directing the viewer to the issue of conflict, to the violence and land grabbing that are part of early colonial history. \r\n\r\nMeders chose the medium of the woodcut because it echoes book plates, as well as the imagery, at the beginning of the story of European presence in North America. The woodcut is a relief printing technology that pre-dates engraving and that emphasizes line and weight, it was used to circulate popular prints, and therefore the means to secure early imagery in the popular imagination. Meders developed the woodcuts and undertook the printing in Museum Volkenkunde and the Hague." .
