The handle is of a double stranded cord of bark fibre and is passed through two small circular holes at each side of the vessel about 4 cm. below the rim. The bowl measures 35 cm. x 14 cm. and is 30.5 cm. deep.\r\nIn a letter to the museum dated 28 October 1892 Miss Bundock identifies the wood used in the making of this bowl as that of the nettle tree (Urtica moroides) and gives the native name for the water vessel as 'Noundule' though her manuscript is difficult to read at this point. In an earlier letter to the Secretary of the Amsterdam Exhibition she says of these vessels, 'wooden bowls made by cutting off and hollowing out the knots whicj grow on certain trees in our district principally on the apple trees (angoffra) [sic]. But the wooden bowls were not so common being more difficult to make and very liable to leak if there was any flaw in the wood'.\r\n\r\nWater vessels: Water carriers included both wooden bowls, and vessels made from the leaves of the bangalow palm. Both the literary evidence and the surviving ethnographic material tend to confirm Miss Bundock's comment that the wooden bowl was not common, so we are fortunate in the preservation of this one example at Leiden. The only other specimen known to the writer (in The Australian Museum) was not available in June 1970. There seems to be only one mention of the type in the historical record, in the memoirs of G.H. Dawson (1834-90:70). This is a brief reference with no detailed description. Miss Bundock notes that this particular specimen was made from the wood of Urtica moroides, a member of the Urticaceae family. The tree is now called Dendrocide moroides. It is a small shrub found only in the far north of New South Wales; the bark of these stinging trees was also used by the Aborigines to make fibre cord for nets and fishing lines (Anderson 1968:182). These bowls seem to be found only in eastern Australia, and are regarded by Davidson (1937:185) as an indigenous development.\r\n\r\nWateremmer (wundall).
