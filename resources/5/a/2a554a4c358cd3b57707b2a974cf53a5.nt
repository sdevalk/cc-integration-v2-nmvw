Ten very long, very thin and pointy wooden skewers are stuck into a wooden shaft, probably made from a hollowed reed like bamboo. The skewers are fixed with rattan strips on two spots. They diverge at the top because the lower tips are pressed tightly into the shaft. One is longer than the others and sticks out.\r\n\r\nThese spears were used for fishing in coastal water." .
