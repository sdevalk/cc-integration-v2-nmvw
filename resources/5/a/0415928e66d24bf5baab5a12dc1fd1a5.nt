<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1181-27> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The bowl is hewn from one piece of palm wood. The diameter is oval and the bowl has no feet. It is flat. The surface is polished with a checkering file and a pumice. It was coloured dark brown after. The bowl has two separately carved handles, which are cut out from the wood together with the bowl. The handles probably served as decoration and not as actual handles to lift the bowl. \r\nThe outer side often has carved decorations, mostly a band around the upper rim which shows geometrical patterns. The handles show reptiles or lizards lying on their back and holding on to two sticks, which are attached to the rim of the bowl.\r\nThe carving of the bowls was the job of men.\r\nThe bowl was used as a dish for food, most likely soup. It was reserved for persons of high rank." .
