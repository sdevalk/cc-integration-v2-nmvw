<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/4aa75949b9041936244e2a430f779e90> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "In 'boekvorm' met etiket.\r\n\r\n\"Stele inscription of Yan Qinli\" (Yan Qin Li bei)\r\n\r\n         The ancient Chinese stele inscription has a long history of around 3 thousand years, which comprises  an important part of Chinese traditional art and culture and stands in a significant position in the Chinese history of art and collection. The Chinese stele inscription is so rich and profound that many aspects of ancient Chinese culture can be reflected by it,  such as social history, folk customs, classic language, literature, calligraphy and sculpture, etc.   \r\n       The Tang Dynasty brought Chinese agricultural society into a plain prosperity at all aspects referring to politics, economy and culture. In such  a promising social circumstance, arts also flourished in abundance, and the calligraphy of Tang Dynasty, especially the \"kai shu\", could be regarded as the acme of Chinese calligraphy history.\r\n     Yan Zhenqing, author of this stele inscription, was one of the greatest calligraphers in Tang Dynasty. His integrity, honesty and righteousness established a high-profiled basis for his artistic creation, because it is believed that the perfect unification of personality and artistic quality is the supreme aim in traditional Chinese art and culture. Yan dedicated his whole life to the pursuit of this ideal perfection  so as to set up a brilliant exemplar for   traditional Chinese literati.\r\n    His contribution to the Chinese calligraphic art consists in the creation of a brand-new calligraphic style. This new style is called \"Yan Ti\"(Yan style) after his name. Totally different from the former style of elegance and fluency dated from the Jin Dynasty, \" Yan Ti\" looks decent but not stiff, fluent but not trifling, and magnificent but not extravagant. To a great extent, it promoted the artistic value of Chinese calligraphy and enriched its artistic vocabulary as well.  \"Yan Ti\" took a irreplaceable position in the history of Chinese calligraphy and made Yan Zhenqing an art master and another founder of calligraphic style after Wang Xizhi.\r\n     \"Yan Qin Li Bei\" was written by Yan Zhenqing himself for his grandfather who was named by Yan Qinli and inscribed in his tombstone. The content tells merits and virtues of the Yan family's ancestors  and outstanding achievements of their generations in Tang Dynasty. The stele was four-sides inscribed when Yan was at the age of 71. It is the representative work in his later years and could be taken as a milestone of \"Yan Ti\"'s artistic accomplishments. At present, the rest part of \"Yan Qin Li Bei\" is conserved in Xi'an Bei Lin as well. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.yuedu.org/books/book-20051028113732UB.htm\r\n   http://www.dangdang.com/product/7452/7452541.shtml\r\nhttp://www.gxceo.com/zw/guoxue/html/guoxue12603_2.html\r\nhttp://bbs.artron.net/viewthread.php?tid=659740&sid=lJr6Gy\r\n\r\nJing Tan, 2008." .
