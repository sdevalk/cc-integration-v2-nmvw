<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/fc7755672e9f199c81561fb5791b2577> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This spatula is made from wood, probably palm wood. It is carved from one piece, as all spatulas are. One end is flat and broad. The middle part is round in diameter and longish. It is not clear what is carved out on the handle here. It is probably the remains of two human figures standing on a pole with their backs to each other. The pole is decorated with engraved triangles which are painted white. The figures probably represent deceased relatives. The wood is very smooth, as it was put in the mouth and no splinters should come off. It was the men's work to manufacture the spatulas, although it was used by men and women, sometimes even children. First, the wood is hewn with an adze. The shape of the spatula is then carved out with a shell knife. The wood is smoothened with leaves from bamboo and other plants which had the effect of sand paper. \r\nSpatulas are found everywhere on the Admiralty islands. In the northwest of the main island Manus, short and broad spatulas with relatively few decoration are dominant. Longer and thinner spatulas with a rich decoration in form of three-dimensional animals and human figures originate on Rambutjo island and are more common on the south coast. \r\nThe spatula was stuck in a gourd and was used to bring the powdery lime from the gourd into the mouth for betel chewing. The lime was mixed in the mouth with betel pepper and areca nut and it helped to extract the active substance from the betel. The betel chewing is an important, everyday activity. Women, men and even children do it while sitting together talking or on almost all other occasions. The consummation can be compared to the smoking of cigarettes in Western societies. It has been practised for a long time. An unripe areca or commonly known betel nut is chewed together with a leaf from the betel pepper. Then the lime, which is made by burning coral or shells, is added to the mixture in the mouth. The lime dissolves the alkaloids in the betel nut which have a stimulating effect, as much as they relieve fatigue and hunger. The mixture is not swallowed." .
