<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1485-218> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This bowl is very large and hewn from one piece of palm wood. The diameter is round and the bowl has four cylindrical feet. The surface is polished with a checkering file and a pumice. The bowl is coloured dark brown after. One can see that there are notches in the rim, where two handles are supposed to go. They are missing. Handles are carved separately and glued to the bowl. \r\nThe outer side has carved decorations, a carved band around the upper rim which shows geometrical patterns. Some symbols that look like a sun are painted on the outside. The carving of the bowls was the job of men. The production of such large festive bowls had probably ceased by the 1930s. \r\n\r\nThe bowl was due to its size not used as a personal dish, but rather as a ceremonial vessel. It was for example used to store all the coconut oil, which was given to a bride on her wedding day. \r\nIt was also used to serve and distribute large portions of accumulated food on ceremonial occasions, which was important to support the redistributional practice in a village." .
