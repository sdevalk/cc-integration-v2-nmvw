<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/0dba5786fd24831ae1302b482ea3f425> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Kamisa (blouse) designed by Lenora Luisa Cabilli for the cloth brand Filip+Inna.\r\nLenora Luisa Cabilli works with local artisans of kalibo aklan, in the Visayas, who still know how to use piña (pine apple fibre) for dressing. The weave is done on a hand loom. The hand embroidery is done by artisans from Lumban, Laguna. She travels extensively throughout the Philippines to work with them. Some makers have added new materials to the pine apple fibre, such as silk or polyester, and weave and embroider them with different types of patterns. The pattern on the dress is the catholic church of San Sebastian, in capital Manila, referencing to a part of the colonial past. The used technique is called calado, which is a thread pulling technique in the types of solihiya (ground embroidery resembling caning) and aspile (filling, resembling pinheads). Other embroidery techniques used are: running stitch, perpilado, tinangkay, baldosa, alay lakad. The San Sebastian collection was created to encourage wear and use of piña for everyday life. The kamisa (blouse) and pañuelo (shoulder cloth) are derived from past traditional fashion styles, which are a merger of European and Asian shapes, whereas the wide trousers add a contemporary twist. Revenues flow back to the makers and their communities. Customers for this fashion are middle to upper class Filipino women, since piña is expensive as the supply is limited today. People also buy them because it ‘reflects their culture,’ sometimes coinciding with the sustainability of the production and wear of the fibre. People wear them to special occasions, but the dress and trousers for example also invite ‘normal’ wear." .
