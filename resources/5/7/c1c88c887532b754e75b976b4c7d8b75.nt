<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-2075-1> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This spear is made completely from wood. A long, thin and very pointy wooden spear head is tied to a wooden shaft, probably made from a hollowed reed like bamboo. The joint is wound with fibre cords and then coated with Parinarium which creates a knob in the middle. The spear head is toothed and is probably an imitation of a ray-spine. It is painted with white, black and red stripes from the tip to the knob. \r\nThe spear is used as a weapon in war and open battle. Due to its lightness, the wooden spear could be hurled from a long distance.  \r\nWarfare was one of the two areas in which the continuing vitality and power of a leading family or leading man were demonstrated. It was therefore crucial for maintaining the social hierarchy and can be seen as having been a normal aspect of life on the Admiralty Islands. The intensity and frequency of raids and fights probably increased after the arrival of Westerners, because they sold iron and weapons to the islanders which were firstly more effective and secondly produced an imbalance of power between the different clans. \r\nAmbushes or raids at dawn were frequent. The actual reasons or causes for attacks are not known, except that a leader would prove his strength and ability. The warriors were mostly young, unmarried adult men which were lead by a clan or group leader. They carried spears, javelins and daggers. All people in the attacked villages were killed, the eyes were gouged out with the sharp obsidian blades and sometimes the heads were cut off to be taken home as a trophy. Houses were burnt down. Fights were also decided on boats on the water." .
