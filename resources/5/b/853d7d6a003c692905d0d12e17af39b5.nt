Images of Mimi spirits are found in some of the oldest rock paintings. According to archeologists, allready 50.000 years ago rockpaintings could be found in this area.Mimi spirits are depicited in quite a few rockpaintins that are 18.000 years old and can still be seen today. They are match-like figures; with a thing body, long limbsand a small head. The Aborigines believed that Mimispainted their self-portraits on rock walls. They are also beleieved to have super natural powers; they could float above the ground and they could lower a ceiling of a cave in order to reach it more easily for painting purposes. \r\nMimis are very timid and shy and they only show themselves during calm nights. Then they will hunt, dance and hold their secret ceremonnies, often accompanied by their playmates to goannas (lizards), echidnas (a kind of hedgehog) and file snakes. They are so fragile that their bones can be broken by the wind. Before the arrival of people they used to inhabit the land together with mythical Aborignal ancestors and creators." .
