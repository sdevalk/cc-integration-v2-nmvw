The bowls are of various sizes, slipped and polished, and are treated differently as to embellishment. Two vessels exhibit decoration on the interior and exterior (362-83 and 84), and two other only have painted designs on the exterior (362-85 and 86). The bowls show paddle-and-anvil marks, fire clouds, and mica flecks. Fontana et.al. (1962:107-109) noted that this type of redware was primarily produced by Papago, Pima, and Maricopa potters living along the tracks of the Southern Pacific Railroad. This redware united the expertise of Papagos in polishing pottery with Pima traditions of using black mesquite paint for decorative purposes. The paint was derived from boiling down shredded sap-soaked mesquite bark with mesquite gum. After applying the decoration on the surfaces of the vessels, they were fired or heated a second time, resulting in the blackening and fixing of the paint (Fontana et.al. 1962:77-78). \r\n\r\n362-33, 34, 35, 82 through 86 Papago pottery\r\n\tPiman pottery is technologically unsophisticated compared to Pueblo ceramics but can be aesthetically attractive. Vessels were built up from wet clay coils that were shaped and smoothed over with a wooden paddle and a stone anvil. When almost dried, the outside was sanded with a stone, after which a clay slip was applied and finally finely sanded with a stone before being fired about twenty minutes in a shallow pit. Decoration was applied on the still warm vessels with gum from mesquite trees (Prosopis), using a sharpened stick. In a short additional firing the decoration turned the decoration on the Pima creamware and Papago redware a deep black. Some designs were inspired by designs from potsherds found in prehistoric Hohokam ruins in the area. Pottery making was a women's craft, and considered a menial art, with little or no associated taboos.\r\n\tThe Papagos were the better potters and they traded their wares, often filled with cactus syrup, with the Pimas, receiving grain in return. The Kohatk Papagos were the main intermediaries, and Russell has surmised that the best Pima potters were of Kohatk descent or learned the craft during extended visits. Underhill has stressed that he craft of pottery, as well as skin dressing and weaving, was only learned after women reached their middle age (Russell 1908:124-131; Underhill 1939:91; Fontana et. al. 1962:9; Hayden 1959:10). The technical aspects of Piman pottery are addressed by Russell (1908:124-128), Beals 1934:28-31; Boggs (1936:102-110), Hill (1942:531-533) and Hayden (1959; also cf. Douglas 1953).\r\nHovens 2009\r\n\r\n\r\nAarden schotel, rood, van binnen zonder ornament, buiten met getande ronde lijnen. Oorspronkelijk opgegeven als Yuma, maar volgens Mrs. W.
