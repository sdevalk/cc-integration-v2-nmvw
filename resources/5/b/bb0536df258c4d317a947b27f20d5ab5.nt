Baggermolen Raja ligt klaar bij Sabang, Sumatra.In 1915 the Colonial Institute Association in Amsterdam announced a competition for submissions of visual material of the Netherlands East Indies so that they could arrange an exhibition in the Netherlands about the colony. A large part of the submitted material was only used later, after the First World War, in the Colonial Instituteâ€™s jubilee exhibition of 1923 . \r\nOne of the submissions in 1917 was a large number (162) of original glass negatives depicting the Singkep Tin Company in the Riau Archipelago. This company was founded in 1889 and was taken over in 1933 by the large NV Billton Maatschappij. The negatives include images showing the activities in the mines, and studio portraits of the employees.\r\nBron: A.
