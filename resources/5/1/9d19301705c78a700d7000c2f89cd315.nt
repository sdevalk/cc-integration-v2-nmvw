Many had specific ceremonial purposes, for example the Aquamanile which were used by the Oba to cleanse himself before certain ceremonies. Others may have been used to present gifts to the Oba or high-ranking chiefs. These tend to be carved in wood, ivory or even cast in brass/bronze - or a combination of these materials. The outer surfaces may be highly decorated with symbolic motifs and decoration. Other containers, in particular pots and flasks are associated with Osun and are worn by Osun priests. Additionally, there is also a wide range of more utilitarian and practical containers, from cups to pottery vessels, the exact use of which is unknown, but may have been used on a daily basis by people in Benin City prior to being looted in 1897 or acquired at some point thereafter.\r\n\r\nEen langwerpig bronzen of messing voorwerp, waarschijnlijk een architectonisch onderdeel, gedecoreerd met slangen." .
