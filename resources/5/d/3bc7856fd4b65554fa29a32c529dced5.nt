In mythologische tijden reisde een grote groep Tingari-mannen, vergezeld door vrouwen en kinderen vanuit het westen naar deze plaats. Nadat ze bij het meer waren aangekomen, stak er een enorme hagelstorm op waarbij ze allemaal omkwamen. Omdat gebeurtenissen die met de Tingari-cyclus te maken hebben geheim zijn, geeft de kunstenaar hier geen verdere details. In het algemeen zijn de Tingari een groep van mythische wezens uit de Droom die over grote afstanden reisden terwijl ze rituelen uitvoerden en speciale plaatsen creeerden.De Tingari mannen werden over het algemeen gevolgd door Tingari vrouwen en vergezeld van novieten en hun reizen en avonturen zijn vastgelegd in een aantal gezangencycli. De mythologieen maken deel uit van de lessen aan geinitieerde jongeren en vormen verklaringen voor hedendaagse gewoonten.\r\n\r\nThis painting depicts designs associated with Kaakuratintja (Lake MacDonald). In mythological times a large group of Tingari Men, accompanied by women and children, travelled from the west to this site. After they arrived at the lake a huge hail storm erupted and they were all killed.\r\nSince events associated with the Tingari Cycle are of a secret nature no further detail was given.\r\nGenerally, the Tingari are a group of mythical characters of the Dreaming who travelled over vast stretches of the country, performing rituals and creating and shaping particular sites. The Tingari Men were usually followed by Tingari Women and accompanied by novices and their travels and adventures are enshrined in a number of song cycles. These mythologies form part of the teachings of the post initiatory youths today as well as providing explanations for contemporary customs.\r\n\r\nDESERT ART\r\n\r\nThe inland of Australia consists mainly of desert. For thousands of years the Aborigines have wandered in small family groups through these immense plains as hunters and food gatherers.\r\n\r\nGovernmental policy\r\nIn the fifties and sixties, groups of Aborigines were put together in governmental settlements. The stated intentionÂ·was: 'to keep the Aborigines under control, tor the sake of their dev opment'. In these 'communities' the government provided some facilities like concrete houses and schools. Some health-care and employment was organised and welfare payments, since traditional food collecting was limited. Residents could only leave their community with the permission of white Australians. When settlements became overpopulated, people were transported with trucks to other settlements. This did not happen out of free will, but was forced. The result was that Aborigines sometimes walked back hundreds of kilometres, whereupon they were once more taken back by truck.\r\n\r\nThe Papunya settlement\r\nIn the seventies a few tribes were forced to live together in Papunya. In 1971 a white art teacher, Geoffrey Bardon, carne to their school. He became interested in traditional painting through his contacts with older Aborigines. The school in which he taught was a concrete building that could use some colour. A mural painting was made by the Aborigines with the traditional designs. After several experiments they started to paint on canvas. Acrylic paint seemed an excellent choice in this dusty area because the paint dries quickly. From Papunya the art movement extended to the other settlements each community developing its own, distinctive style.\r\n\r\nThe paintings\r\nMost of the paintings consist of dots and circles. The men were the first to transfer to the acrylic-canvas medium. Their work is highly symbolic: representing ancestral history and nomadic routes. The paintings often look like maps, seen from the sky. Only a person with considerable knowledge of the depicted locations and the dreamings related to them can understand the symbols properly. A circle may represent a campsite, waterhole or fire. More and more women have started to paint in recent years. Their subjects often have to do with the search tor and the preparation of food. They are also inspired by ceremonial body-paint designs." .
