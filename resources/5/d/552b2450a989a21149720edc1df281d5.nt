<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7250-1> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Drawing by Theodoor van Erp (1874–1958) of the North-East corner of the Borobudur.\r\nVan Erp was a lieutenant and a major of the Engineering Corps of the KNIL.  He played a leading role in saving and preserving the famous Borobudur, because he succesfully conducted the first major restoration project of the monument, between 1907 en 1911. According to A.J. Bernet Kempers in his important work \"Ageless Borobudur; Buddhist Mystery in Stone-Decay and restoration\" (Wassenaar 1976): “By carefully avoiding the introduction of any new sculpture Van Erp set an example the Archaeological Service faithfully followed in later years. Van Erp’s views on the restoration of monuments were very progressive compared with those in vogue for Dutch buildings in the Netherlands at the same time (p.199)”\r\n\r\nBorobudur is one of the most important Buddhist monuments in the world, built in Central Java around the year 800. It has been photographed, drawn and painted many times, especially from the same angle, the North-East corner. This is the angle from which the complex is best viewed. From this particular angle, one of the 504 meditating Boeddha statues, which belong to the niches along the terraces, is piecefully sitting under the trees. This makes the drawing artistically more interesting, but also documents the decay of the monument by the end of the 19th century when many statues had fallen out or taken from the niches." .
