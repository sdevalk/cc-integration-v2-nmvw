<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-5715-2608> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The first Seminole dolls noticed in the late nineteenth century were relatively simple and made of sticks and rags. Later on, the dolls took a more human shape though this was against a taboo of the Seminole and Miccosukees; they believed that creating an image of something brought misfortune and bad luck. However, the growing tourist industry made the Seminole realize that they could make money by selling the dolls to tourists.\r\nAs early as 1918, women manufactured dolls dressed in traditional Indian dress and sold them from their chickees. After the Tamiami railway track was constructed in the 1930's, villages along that track started selling a lot of hand-made products in gift shops. Women from the everglades and other remote areas travelled long distances to Miami to sell their dolls in the gift shops. The dolls became very popular and the small craft booth at Dania Reservation could not reach the demands of the tourists in the 1930's. \r\nFirst, palmetto fiber (Sabal) is cut and dried several days after which heads and bodies are made. The head is stuffed with scrap palmetto fiber and tied off at the neck. Eyes and mouth are sewn on with commercial colored thread. The head is then attached to cylindrical body without arms or legs. A circular cardboard base is covered with fiber and then attached to the bottom of the stuffed body. Finally, the doll maker makes the dresses for the dolls herself or sells the dolls to other women who sew the clothing.\t\t\t\t \tThe clothing consists of two pieces and represents the traditional female Seminole costume. Several bands of colored cloth are sewn together to form the skirt and cape. The skirt is sewn onto the body. Smaller dolls have less elaborate costumes. Cloth or yarn imitates the hairstyle although sometimes human hair is used. \tTo finish the doll, jewellery is added, usually many strings of multi-colored beads. The more expensive dolls have earrings as well. \t\r\nMost dolls represent women although more doll makers started to make male dolls or pairs of male and female dolls for sale in the 1940's. \tDoll making is an important source of income of many families. There is also a doll-making competition with cash prizes at the annual Seminole Tribal Fair." .
