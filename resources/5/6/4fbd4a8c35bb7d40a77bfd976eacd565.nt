<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/b2a501f01f38f62a5e618be6755079e3> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Not far from Ramingining there is a place called Moitjwakalanal (place of snake Moitj), where many black headed pythons and lizards live with Motj among four large rocks. If anyone attempts to injure them the pythons will kill them with lightning.\r\n\r\nIt is these pythons who were the Creators of the land surrounding the Arafura Swamp. They are called karritjarr or gumungu and are the dreaming of the artit's grandmother, who gave her permission to paint them when she passed through her agegrading ceremony. They are also the precursors of the wet season, creating lightning by standing up on their tails and thrusting their forked tongues into the stormclouds. In so doing their spittle infiltrates the clouds with rain, bringing the first signs of the wet season, called 'the nose of the wet season'. The pythons remain erect and sway back and forth as the currents of the northeast wind, lungurrma, bring strong gusts of wind and bnshowers. Now the people know there will be a period of great fertility as trees and plants sprout green growth and dried up rivers run with fresh water.\r\nThe karritjarr dreaming relates back to the time of Wititj, the great Rainbow Serpent, who became angry when his pool was polluted by two Dreamtime women called the Wagilag Sisters.\r\n\r\nHe rose up on his tail high into the sky, calling on all other reptiles to join with him in piercing the heavy stormclouds, which he had created with the vapour from his breath.\r\n\r\nTheir combined efforts released a great flood, which spread across the land, at the height of which Wititj slid across and swallowed both girls and their babies, later regurgitating them onto dry land where they turned into rocks.\r\n\r\nWhereas the karritjarr are the precursors of the wet season, Wititj is the Rainbow Serpent who then causes monsoonal rains, floods, and the rainbows, which are across the sky.\r\n\r\nArnhem Land artists rarely use colours other than the basic red, yellow, black and white. Red and yellow are derived from the ochres that are found in the ochre pits. Black derives from charcoal. White is made from plaster or pipe clay. The material is finely ground and mixed with water, then mixed with a binder. The simple throw-away brushes are made of bark fibres, human hair, chewed twigs and thin shoots. Subjects portrayed are related to daily life. On the coast, for example, the hunting of turtle, dugong, crocodile and all kind of fish are depicted. Inland, the hunting of kangaroos, fresh water crocodiles and birds. Other images have to do with personal totem stories and Dreamtime histories." .
