The monastery had its own photographic studio, which produced a large number of photos of life in South Africa in the late 19th century. The series also includes a small number of photos of San rock art including this one.\r\n\r\nThis photo depicts the most prominent panel of rock art found at Game Pass Shelter in the present day Maloti-Drakensberg Park. The rock art at the site is several hundred to several thousand years old. This particular panel came to international attention after a photograph of the panel was published in Scientific American in 1915. It has been the subject of study and academic debate since that time.\r\n\r\nThe panel is sometimes called the 'Rosetta Stone' of San rock art. The panel depicts a human-like figure with hooved feet, grasping the tail of a dying Eland. Before the 1970s, literal interpretations of San rock art were favoured. According to these interpretations, the figure is a human and is grabbing the tail of the Eland as a display of courage. \r\n\r\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, a new interpretation emerged of the work. This interpretation was influenced by the testimony of Qin, a San man who in 1873 had acted as a guide for colonial administrators who studied San rock art in the Natal region. According to this interpretation, the man grasping the tail of the Eland is a shaman. Both the eland and the man are dying. The shaman is going into a trance, preparing to leave this world and takes on the power of the Eland, which is most powerful animal. \r\n\r\nThe images are therefore not literal, but act as visual metaphors showing the experiences of shamans undergoing trances. The shamanistic interpretation of San rock art has since become the dominant framework for researchers studying the enormous corpus of San rock art in South Africa." .
