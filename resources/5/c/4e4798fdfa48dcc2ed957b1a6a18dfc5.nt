Rendieren in het arctische toendra landschap zijn een geliefd onderwerp.\r\n\r\nThe development of art in Uelen:\r\n\"Here in the northern and narrowest part of the Bering Strait, the contact with visiting whale hunters and merchants were the most intensive. In the 1920s, the people of the village of Uelen were the first to form a seasoned team of carvers, who began to teach bone carving at the local school. In 1931, a bone carving workshop was founded in Uelen, being the first one in Chukotka. The major role in founding the workshop was played by Tengrynkeu - one of the most repsected men in the area. Tengrynkeu was an energetic and enterprising man. In his younger years he had been a succesful hunter, then a sailor on an American schooner. Later he was a local Soviet authority. Like many others in Uelen he was a carver himself.\" (Bronstein at all 2002:5)\r\nTogether with his brother Vukvutagin, who was also a talented artist, Tengrynkeu organised a group of older carvers which was to become the very basis of the later workshop. In their pictoral art on bone carving, scenes of daily life prevail, including tent dwellings (yaranga); hunting seals, whales, and polar bears; and riding on a reindeer sledge. Pictoral art has largely replaced the geometrical decoration found in earlier ethnographical artefacts. \r\nDuring the 1930s, Russian artists were sent to many places in Siberia - Chukotka included - to educate native artists, who were organised in so-called brigades. It was in this way that the Russian artist and art historian Alexander Gorbunkov came to the Uelen workshop. Gorbunkov consolidated the group of Chukchi (and Yuit) artists, including young craftskmen. One of them was the talented engraver Vuvkol. In the 1990-2000, the Uelen carving workshop (also called Uelen Art Studio) is named after him. According to Bronstein et al.,  Gorbunkov was not only important for sculptural art, but also for the graphical art of the Chukchi: He [Gorbunkov] was very careful with the national artists traditions and believed his main goals was to create the best conditions for self-realization for the artists. He highly believed that collective forms of work had a special meaning in folk art. The art historian insisted that carvers discuss the subject matters of their work together. These discussions often turned into real pantomime performances that helped find the brightest and clearest images.\r\nGorbunkov was actually the first to teach artists of Chukchi Peninsula to work with pencils. He suggested drwaing sketches of their future sculptoral and graphic compositions on paper. (Bronsteing et all. 2002: 7). (Taken from Buijs 2016: 18-19)" .
