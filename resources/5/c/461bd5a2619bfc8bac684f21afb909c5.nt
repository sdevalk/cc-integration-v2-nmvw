The strings are tied together on both ends to make a wide belt. Several black, blue and especially red glass beads are inserted in intervals to connect the stings. \r\nThis belt is worn by women and men and is fixed with a knot in the front. Women also wear it as an adornment on the back, where it hangs loosely down. Men wear it the same way but only on the chest." .
