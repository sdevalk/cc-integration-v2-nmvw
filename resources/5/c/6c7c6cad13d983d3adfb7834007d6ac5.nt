De man werd zittend gefotografeerd naast een meetlat. Hij draagt ook armbanden aan zijn bovenarmen en een riem om zijn middel. Woolna verwijst naar een plaatsnaam Cape Woolna. De man behoort eigenlijk tot de Djerimanga stam. (Wonu Veys, juni 2011). \r\n\r\nAboriginal man with white beard and scarifications on chest. The man was photographed seated with a measuring tape next to him. He is wearing armbands and a belt. Woolna refers to the place name Cape Woolna. The man actually belongs to the Djerimanga tribe (Wonu Veys, juni 2011).\r\n\r\nDjerimanga portraits\r\nPaul Foelsche referred to the Djerimanga people as the Woolner. That term actually applied to Cape Woolner, where South Australian surveyors first encountered the Djerimanga in 1864. In fact, in Foelsche's words, the Djerimanga's territory was centred on 'both sides the Adelaide River for some sixty miles up it'.\r\n\r\nThe Finniss expedition of 1864-66 clashed with Djerimanga people and at least two were killed. Three years later, the young surveyor J.W.O. Bennett was speared in reprisal, close to the Adelaide River. This event, more than any other, led to Paul Foelsche's appointment in charge of a Northern Territory police force.\r\n\r\nFor several years the Djerimanga remained on uneasy terms with the South Australians, and with the Larrakia, on whose land the new settlements of Port Darwin and Palmerston were based. The Djerimanga camped outside Palmerston at first, but gradually established a permanent presence.\r\n\r\nFoelsche took his first photographs of the Djerimanga during November 1877. His original list identifies several individuals by name. Other observers noted that the Djerimanga and Larrakia intermarried, but Foelsche's lists, which include husband and wives, do not suggest this.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1890s Emu, or Lamaby became the recognised Djerimanga 'headman'. He acted as a guide and assistant when the South Australian Governor and Edward Stirling were taken on an Adelaide River cruise by Paul Foelsche (see image no.47 in Crocodiles and river cruises -section). Emu also became the main source of data on Djerimanga language and culture for the South Australian anthropologist T.A. Parkhouse.\r\n\r\nPaul Foelsche arrived in Port Darwin just as the study of other peoples and cultures was being recognised as a new field of Western science, 'Anthropology'. Foelsche contributed to this study, by recording vocabularies and making observations on the culture of the Larrakia, Woolna and Iwaidja peoples. His portrait photographs became a crucial element in this anthropological record.\r\n\r\nFoelsche's first anthropological records were his 1874 photographs of Larrakia camps. His portrait photography was initially made with a measuring scale, but his participation in the photography sections of International Exhibitions gave his photographs a broader appeal. He began carefully recording the names of his sitters, and their personal details. This was quite unusual for nineteenth-century anthropology.\r\n\r\nDuring 1880 Foelsche responded to E.M. Curr's Australia-wide survey, supplying descriptions of the Larrakia and the Unalla (Iwaidja) peoples, together with samples of their vocabularies.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the South Australian Museum, Foelsche prepared a fuller account of the Larrakia, submitting this to the Adelaide branch of the Royal Society in 1881, together with a set of anthropometric photographs.\r\n\r\nDuring 1889 Foelsche responded to a call from the South Australian Museum and made a carefully documented collection of artefacts, listing their Aboriginal names and uses. During this period Foelsche prepared several collections for other museums and collectors.\r\n\r\nIn his time, Foelsche was an acknowledged authority on anthropology. By today's standards, this reputation does not bear close examination. Although he was careful to record Aboriginal names correctly, he spoke only a form of Aboriginal pidgin English. He made one attempt to document Larrakia and Iwaidja origin myths, but he had little understanding of Aboriginal religion or social structure. Indeed, few Europeans did.\r\n\r\nBut Foelsche clearly appreciated that Aboriginal society had its own valid laws, and that European law was an alien imposition. He understood his own role in altering that balance. Writing to a friend in Germany after his retirement, Foelsche put it in these terms:\r\n\r\n    This is an Old Country with an Old People. The New People must remember the claims of the Old People. They were here first, and they have their established customs and institutions. So far as those customs and institutions can be related to our standards, they must be respected. For illegalities, there must be understanding.\r\n    — S. Downer, Patrol Indefinite, 1963\r\n\r\nPhotographs\r\n\r\nPaul Foelsche's photography of Aboriginal people began as a response to the late 19th century interest in 'racial types', as a branch of the new 'science' of Anthropology. These first images often incorporated a measurement scale. But Foelsche saw these people as individuals, rather than as scientific specimens. He began recording the names of his subjects, their ages and language groups.\r\n\r\nThe Aboriginal people in Foelsche's portraits had to keep still for two or three seconds, in order to produce a clear, unblurred image. This fixed pose tended to make them appear serious, even concerned, but the same may be said of European portraits of the late 19th century. Despite Foelsche's role as a law-enforcer, the evidence suggests that Aboriginal people were willing participants in his photographic project. (gekopieerd door W.Veys, juni 2011)\r\n\r\nA Note on Foelsche's Portraits\r\nLike his landscape photographs, Foelsche's portraits also cast light on the photographer and his techniques. They also raise many questions about Foelsche's relationship with those sitting for his portraits – more than 260 Aboriginal individuals over a period of 15 years, from 1877 to 1891.\r\n\r\nSitting or Standing\r\nFoelsche commenced his series of Aboriginal portraits in November 1877. He began by photographing people standing next to a measuring scale, following anthropological procedure. He soon found that this was unsatisfactory, as standing figures were more likely to move and blur the picture, despite his use of a metal support stand.\r\nDuring the 1880s most of his subjects are seated on a bentwood-backed chair. Foelsche found that by asking people to hold their arms in a slightly crossed fashion, he could mask the presence of the chair's bentwood back. It is still visible though, in many of his portraits. While most of his subjects had never sat on a chair before, it seems to have provided a more comfortable setting.\r\n\r\nNakedness\r\nUnlike many nineteenth-century photographers of Aboriginal people in south-eastern Australia, Paul Foelsche did ask his subjects to remove clothing. In many cases, they already were unashamedly naked. This fact was commented on by prudish townspeople in Palmerston, for example. After 1880, Foelsche supplied men and women with lower garments of printed fabric, which they wore specifically for the portraits. The same garment appears in multiple portraits.\r\n\r\nA Matt Effect\r\nIn several portraits, an individual's face seems a little darker, as though blackened slightly. Foelsche acknowledged this in a 1909 conversation with the anthropologist William Ramsay Smith. He had found that his first portraits suffered from high contrast, resulting from reflections on people's shiny faces. His solution was to ask them to apply powdered charcoal to their faces. All this suggests that, at Palmerston and Port Essington, as elsewhere, Aboriginal people may have regarded the photographic process as a mysterious rite of passage.\r\n\r\nEstimating Ages\r\nFoelsche's surviving photographic lists form the basis of the documentation of his portrait series. His record of people's names appears to be reliable. Their ages are his estimates though, probably arrived at by reference to key events, such as the departure of British from Port Essington (1848), or the arrival of the South Australians at Escape Cliffs (1864).\r\n\r\nRespecting the Old People\r\nDespite his role as a powerful police official, Paul Foelsche prepared these portraits with great care and sympathy. The people they depict all passed away several generations ago, and these images can be regarded safely now, without offending the living or the spirits of the dead.\r\nAs the Larrakia artist, Gary Mura Lee, puts it, 'we see past the measuring stick and all that it represents and we see strong, beautiful people – our people'.
