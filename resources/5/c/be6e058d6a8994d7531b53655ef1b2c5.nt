<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7106-82> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This painting shows country on Texas Downs Station neasr Turkey Creek W.A. Where Major, an Aboriginal Bush Ranger, hid out around the turn of the century. Major was a Wardaman man who was brought to Gija country in Western Australia by a cattle station boss who treated him very badly. He killed three white men: the first at Banana Spring and then a manager and cook at Jiyilengem-birri Nawarragawoony (Blackfella Creek). The police chased him up to Darloo-Darloo (Nine Mile) where he hid on a hill. He used to hide up on the top in the daytime. At night he lowered a rope ladder and climbed down until morning, He told all the other Aboriginal people not to come near him so they wouldnâ€™t get in to trouble. One day he climbed down and fled across the country and the police finally caught up with him and shot him at Mistake Creek. In the painting the hill where Major hid up can be seen on the left, with a creek flowing nearby. On the right is a cave called Rowliny, which was another of his hiding places." .
