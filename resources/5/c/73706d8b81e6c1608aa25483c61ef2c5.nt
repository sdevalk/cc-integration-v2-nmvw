Yuma flutes typically have four holes in the middle section, and are played transversely. The incised designs on this flute are applied in three equally divided segments, and filled in with reddish-brown pigment. The joints of the cane flute are decorated with a red painted band (see picture below). In addition to these long flutes, the Yumas crafted shorter flageolets with three holes and a plugged end, to be played vertically. These instruments were used in courting rather than for accompanying songs. According to Yuma legend, the two sons of a yellow breasted bird were the first to carve a flute and used it to make girls fall in love (Herzog 1928:189; Forde 1931:131; Densmore 1932: 25-27,49, plate 25-26; Spier 1933:131; 1936:18; Kaemlein 1954:8-10; Trippel 1984:174, fig. 2).\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)" .
