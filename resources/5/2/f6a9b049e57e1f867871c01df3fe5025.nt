<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/c6cfff7ecc300da6cfc1c143c770a0d6> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This is a poster that most prominently displays a swastika, an auspicious symbol in Hindu religious traditions. The top line reads, in Hindi script: 'OM GANAPATYA NAMAH' which is an auspicious utterance to the god Ganesha. At the bottom, in Hindi script, it reads: SUBH LABH, which translates to auspicious gains. This poster is therefore a wonderful example of a popular cultural devotional object that a devotee might hang at home, in an office, or place of business to create an auspicious space.\r\nThe swastika is an early example of  Hindu religious symbol, although it is most often associated with German National Socialism (Nazism). National Socialism was profoundly interested in the outdated racial theory of the superior Aryan race as a light-skinned, militarily superior group of people who swept into the South Asian continent and conquered existing populations. It was their mistaken claim that the descendants of this so-called 'race' were those blonde-haired, blue-eyed, light skinned Europeans. When National Socialists appropriated the swastika, they featured in backwards on their flags and whenever they used it. \r\n\r\nThe word 'Aryan' does indeed exist in the earliest oral and written canons of Hindu practice, known as the Vedas. However, this word means 'noble', and most likely denotes a class of people, rather than a race. Archaeological and historical research into the period do not suggest an invasion by a foreign group of peoples, but instead a more gradual migration and intermixing of cultures and religions in the region.\r\n\r\nThe swastika remains a Hindu symbol that is ubiquitous in South Asia, but also in diasporic temples, although due to the symbol's complex histories and affect associated with it, you will find it less prominently in public Hindu spaces in diasporic European and North American spaces." .
