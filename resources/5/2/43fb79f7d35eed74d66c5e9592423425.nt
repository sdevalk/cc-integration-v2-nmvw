<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1485-343> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The ladle is made of half a coconut shell and a wooden ladle. The hollowed out and smoothed coconut is parted in half (not necessarily evenly). A carved wooden ladle of different size and adornment is glued to the coconut. It is always attached in the inside. The manufacture was the work of the men, as is almost all carving  and wood work. \r\nDifferent kinds of adornments can be identified. They most probable don't have a special meaning, but are expression of the artist's creativity. Animal or human figures are probably an allusion to ancestral beings and totems. This handle is very long and straight. It goes through a hole from the outside into the inside of the coconut where it is fixed. At the upper end there is a stylised crocodile's head. The head is coloured white and the coconut shell red. It looks as if a person is emerging from the reptile's mouth. The crocodile is one of the most important ancestral beings which created the earth and everything that is on it today. It is naturally closely associated with the water, which is considered the most important of the primal elements and in which the dead souls and ancestral beings dwell. The crocodile therefore represents an earthly link to the second world of the spirits, with which people constantly try to interact. The picture of the man emerging from the crocodile could represent the protective relationship between the ancestral being and the human.\r\nA loop of fibre cord is attached to the head, probably to be able to hang up the ladle.\r\n\r\nThe ladle was used to scoop liquids and solid food from pots and kettles, often from a big wooden bowl. This was often done on feasts, to give out soup to guests. The ladles were kept in the house of the men and were sometimes a present to guests." .
