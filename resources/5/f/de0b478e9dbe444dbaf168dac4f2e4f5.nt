But it is also possible that the vessel was used for drinking water at royal banquets.  According to the report of Aernoudt Lintgensz, who was in Bali in 1597, already in the sixteenth century golden vessels were used at the court of Gelgel.  Usually a caratan is made of clay and can serve all sorts of purposes in a household. For use as royal gifts sometimes only the spout or the lid are gold , but this rare example is entirely made of gold.\r\nIt is very likely manufactured by the goldsmiths (pande mas) who worked to order for the court of the Dewa Agung and for his family in other palaces in Klungkung, and lived in nearby Banjar Pande Mas in Kamasan.  Before the puputan, fifteen goldsmiths worked more or less fulltime at the courts. They were particularly busy at times of major rituals.\r\nFor modeling royal vessels and ceremonial boxes, the goldsmiths used a thin sheet of gold, called peripihan.  The sheet was beaten out of a lump of gold. For the water vessel the sheet was hammered by hand into its basic shape with a rounded hammer and punch. The surface of the golden caratan has been left plain, with the exception of delicately embossed foliate meanders or tendril ornamentation on a rim around the spout and the motif of a lotus flower on the lid. The decorations in relief, achieved by repouss√© technique (embossing from the back), were applied after hammering the vessel into shape. Final touches to the decoration were worked by chasing or chiseling from the front. The different parts, like the spout, were soldered together later.\r\n\r\nThis golden water jar was seized by Dutch troops at the palace of Klungkung, after the so-called Puputan Klungkung on 28 April 1908." .
