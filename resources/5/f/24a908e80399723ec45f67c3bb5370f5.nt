<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-360-4032> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Een klein laag tafeltje op vier gebogen en naar buiten staande pootjes. Het blad van de tafel is van zeer dik hout gemaakt, mogelijk wat wel bekend is als 'fossiel hout' of umoregi, dat vooral in Noord-Japan, in de streek rond Sendai werd gevonden. Bovenblad en de vier pootjes in Chinees-aandoende stijl zijn in de tsugarunuri techniek gelakt, de onderkant egaal zwart verlakt. Tafels als deze, in hun tijd al als zeer bijzonder beschouwd, werden bij voorkeur in de tokonoma geplaatst.\r\n\r\nAnonymous: Formal Stand\r\nIn his fascinating study Japan nach Reisen und Studien (xx, 1886, pp. 428f.; also: The Industries of Japan, New York, 1889, p. 361), Johann Rein (1835-1918) remarks that 'Tsugaru-nuri is not frequently seen, at least in European collections, as its manufacture demands much time, and its price is correspondingly high. The best older specimens of it, /…/ I saw at the Hague (Museum of Curiosities), /…/.' It is thus most likely that this formal stand or table was among the objects he admired when viewing the Leiden collections in their original presentation at the Royal Cabinet of Curiosities. \r\nIt also figured among the prized objects in the collection made by Johan van Overmeer Fisscher (1800-1848) during his stay in Japan, employed at Deshima from 1820 to 1829. He ranged this table in the MS-catalogue of his collection under the Section Antiquities and Curiosities, remarking that it was made of wood dating 'from the earliest times of the pre-history, around the Japanese deluge'. In fact, the leaf of the table is made of fossilized wood, umoregi, probably from around Sendai in the north of Honshu Island. The four legs are carved of wood and shaped in a style slightly reminiscent of Chinese furniture. Thereupon, the stand was lacquered in the technique known as Tsugarunuri, after the district of Tsugaru in the far north of Honshu. Its peculiarity consists in the application of three or four different colours, black, red, yellow and green, proceeding from roiro, cinnabar, orpiment and seishitsu lacquer, which are mingled so as to render a  marbled effect after polishing. In this case, black and red are the predominant colours.\r\nThough difficult to date, it may be assumed that Fisscher acquired it as an antiquity at quite a high price. It may therefore date from the first decades of the nineteenth century, but also, and more likely even, from the late eighteenth century. It bears witness of Fisscher's great discrimination in making his collection, his appreciation of Japanese culture in all its variety and richness and still today, represented in the permanent display of the museum, it makes its contribution to our understanding of Japanese culture.\r\n\r\nThis object probably acquired at Edo during the 1822 court journey to that city in which Fisscher partook.\r\n\r\nThis description was written for the ASEMUS virtual master pieces project.\r\nAdditional:\r\nJohan van Overmeer Fisscher (1800-1848) came to Japan as a servant employed in various capacities at Deshima, from 1820 to 1829. Much like Captain Blomhoff, also Fisscher made an extensive collection of objects with the explicit purpose of elucidating to the Dutch audience what Japanese culture entailed. When his collection was bought by King William I for the Royal Cabinet of Curiosities, there appeared to be hardly any exhibition space left, whereupon his collection was displayed in the nearby buildings of the Coin Bureau at The Hague. In general, it may be said that his collection was smaller than that made by Blomhoff, yet the overall quality and the understanding of Japanese culture witnessed in the items is even better. Otherwise, the Blomhoff collection has a history similar to that of Blomhoff, that is, it was moved to Leiden in 1883 when the Rotal Cabinet was dissolved.\r\n Cf objects from the Blomhoff Collection\r\n Cf objects from the Siebold Collection" .
