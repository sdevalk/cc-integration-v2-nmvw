Over de zijde van het handvat met zigzags van rotan. Dwars over de tanden rijen veelkleurige kraaltjes.\r\n\r\nSande distinguished two kinds of wooden combs, according to whether they are made of one single piece of wood or of several pieces tied together. The latter could be divided in two categories namely, those of which the material is bamboo and those of palm wood.\r\nMost of these combs have, however, a narrow handle, in consequence of the strong flattening, made at that part of the pins. Some comb handles have a varying breadth, a result obtained by the varying breadth of the component parts, also sometimes obtained by adding extra pins to the handle. Some combs have two handles (see 1528-156) each formed a continuation of a group of pins. According to Sande and the researches of J. Jeswiet the pins were made with leaf-sheaths of Arenga saccharifera. \r\nThe areca-nut, after removing the kernel, stuck on the end of the handle and fastened with a black sticking material, forms a very common ornament of these combs. A strip of hairy couscous skin wound round the handle and fastened with a bark fibre tied round. Sometimes there are also strips of red calico, feathers, or Cardamomum leaves. \r\nThe ornamental comb stuck in the hair and thus carried about, in order always to have them at hand. The long points also make it possible to use the combs as scratchers. Combs were according to Sande, almost exclusively worn by men.\r\nSande claimed that people from Sentani Lake wore less comb and generally less ornament than their neighbour from Humboldt Bay." .
