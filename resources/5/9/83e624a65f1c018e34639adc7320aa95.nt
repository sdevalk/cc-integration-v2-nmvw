Due to white encroachment on their lands, they were forced to accept a treaty in 1864. Subsequent opposition of part of the tribe against displacement resulted in the Modoc War of 1872-73, led by Kintpuash, popularly known as Captain Jack. After their defeat, the Modocs were removed to the Quapaw Agency in Indian Territory where they suffered from disease and corrupt administration (Murray 1959; Hurtado 1981; Stern 1998:460-462).\r\nDeer and waterfowl were the favorite pray of the Modocs, although fishing also contributed significantly to their diet. Antelope and mountain sheep were also hunted. In addition to bows and arrows, hunters used clubs in communal hunts when deer were driven into water or into a pound. The broad and flat bow from the Ten Kate collection is typical of the northern California type of bow. The Modocs preferred wood from juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) and yew (Taxus brevifolia) for this type of weapon. The Leiden specimen is strung with twisted sinew, and the feathers are fastened to the arrow shafts with sinew. The arrows are made of wood, often mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius), but reeds were also used. The bow and arrows are painted with geometric designs in yellow, red, black and blue, typically of the war bow. The arrowheads are missing, and are usually made from obsidian, prevalent in ancestral Modoc territory. General Crook once observed that the Indians of Oregon Territory were able to make fifty to sixty arrowheads from obsidian in an hour. Quivers were made of tule mats. The main enemies of the Modocs were the Achomawis, with the Shastas a close second. However, they were allied with the Klamaths (Franks 1873; Mason 1894:670, plate xcii; Kroeber 1925:332; Ray 1963:vii,134-143,189; Stern 1998:449,452-453; cf. Spier 1930:194-196).\r\n(Hovens 2009)" .
