<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/c7cc7e36cfed9aece57471a17988f861> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This apron is made of plant fibres, white shell discs, beads and Pallaquium nut shells. There are different parts of the apron. The upper half is a plaited plant fibre belt (in this case very broad), which has strings attached to tie it around the hip. On this there are some adornments in form of strings of shell discs and nut shells.\r\nThe other half is made of several widths of cord with shell discs (shell money), in which dark beads are plaited to make a pattern. The bottom parts are loose cords which again have shell money and nut shells tied to them for decoration.\r\nThe shell discs are also called shell money, because large amounts of them were used for trading, ceremonial exchange or were part of a woman's wedding attire. The large amount used for the apron are an indicator that it was valuable and therefore mostly worn by high-positioned women. \r\nTheir value came from their difficult manufacturing process, which was a woman's job. The small shells have to be drilled to make a hole in the centre. Then the top is cut off and the discs are polished. \r\nThe apron was worn specifically at dancing ceremonies or at wedding ceremonials when it served as wedding attire. They were not used for everyday-purposes." .
