<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/b4e7b53645a11b8e7ec99e057ec4f96f> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Telephone cover with tughra\r\n\r\nThe tughra was initially used as a monogram for the Ottoman sultans. It had a specific design that contained two loops on the left side, three vertical lines in the middle, and two extentsions on the right side. In general the tughra was filled with a specific formula that contained in Arabic calligraphy: the name of the Sultan, his father's name, his titles, and ended with the phrase 'the one who is always victorious'. The tughra was visible on official documents, coins, furniture etc. Later on the tughra was also transformed to the religious sphere. The design remained the same, but the tughra was filled with religious formulas.  \r\n\r\nWith the founding of the Turkish Republic in 1923 the official status of the tughra ended, but the design itself survived. Contemporary forms of tughras are used in private houses, cars, shops and businesses and reflect not only religious sentiments but also display signs of nostalgia and a continuation of symbols (such as the tughra-design as it was originally constructed as the monogram of the Ottoman sultan) connected to Ottoman history. This telephone cover with a tughra illustrates the transformation of the Ottoman Empire to the Turkish Republic. The typical desigin of the tughra is visible, but it contains the text Istanbul written in Latin script instead of Arabic. In other words, it is a reflection of the current Turkish society and its interaction with the traditional tughra design. Beneath the letter U, the year 1453 is written, thereby referring to the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople (Istanbul) from the Byzantine Empire. Therefore, the object can also be perceived as political and controversial." .
