It is made from a few flat pieces of sago-leaf stem put together with rattan. The bottom is painted white and the top part is in black with red edges. The sides are decorated with feathers. The flexible wooden stick (arib) is put through the hole and attached to the performer's headgear.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            \r\nThe clan emblem was carried by a waiko-ti or dema-performer in a mayo cult dance, waiko-zi, connected with re-enactment of some particular mythical episode during the Marind cult celebration. The waiko-zi includes a small dema-wir (Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 9): \"The dancers wear skirts made of fringed coconut-leaves or painted fibres. They also have fibres tied to their arms. A long elastic rod has been inserted in their hairdo, with, at the top, the image of a bird or some other animal, made of very light material and painted in bright colours. The image swings to and fro with every step...\" (Van Baal, 1966: 853-854).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \t\tIVANA HLADKA, 20.11. 2006" .
