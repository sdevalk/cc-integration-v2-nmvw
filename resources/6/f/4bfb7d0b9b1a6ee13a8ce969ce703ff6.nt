A number of Chemehuevi children visited the agency day school that was established in 1881. From a pupil Ten Kate acquired four pottery effigies. He also noted the similarity of pottery among the Yumas, Mohaves, and Chemehuevis.\r\n\r\n362-205, 206, 207, 208\r\nChemehuevi ceramic busts; pottery; h. 8.8-10.5 cm.; 1883.\r\nThe similarity of pottery among the Yumas, Mohaves and Chemehuevis as observed by Ten Kate was as well the result of the Mohaves trading their wares with neighboring groups, as the Chemehuevis producing their own pottery and being substantially influenced by the craft of their neighbors (cf. Rogers 1936:38; Baldwin 1950:52). It was the women who made the pottery. The Chemehuevis dug the preferred clay with a spade made from mesquite, and mixed this with crushed white rock for temper. Vessels were constructed with clay coils, smoothed inside and out by the paddle-and-anvil method, using a smooth stone on the inside, and a cottonwood bark paddle on the outside surface. Cottonwood bark and wood was also used for firing. Sometimes red and black designs were applied with natural pigments (Van Valkenburgh 1976:10-11,23). The Southern Paiutes, including the Chemehuevis, had their own pottery tradition that was less developed because of their semi-nomadism. Moreover, pottery making declined substantially soon after the arrival of white settlers and the introduction of western trade goods among most bands (Lowie 1924:225-226; Rogers 1936:38; Baldwin 1950; Stewart 1967:16).\r\nTopilla, a Chemehuevi pupil at the government Indian day school in Parker, showed artistic qualities by creating naturalistic clay effigies of humans and animals and making accomplished pencil drawings. Ten Kate purchased four small human effigy busts from her. It is not known whether the pottery classes during which these were made were part of the conventional art training in the regular curriculum at the school, or that these classes were organized because of the strong pottery tradition among the Mohaves that was later adopted by the Chemehuevis. In the base of one effigy (RMV 362-207) the name of Topilla is carved. This was probably encouraged by her teacher, but possibly suggested by Ten Kate. Small pottery effigies had been made for a long time among the Paiutes, and were used as children's toys (Fowler and Matley 1979:84).\r\n\r\nThe women teachers told Ten Kate that the Chemehuevi youngsters generally were more intelligent than their Mohave counterparts. They had observed the same for boys compared to girls. Intertribal personality differences were also noted, the Chemehuevis being headstrong and unforgiving while the Mohaves were impulsive but lighthearted and humorous according to the notes of the Dutch anthropologist.\r\n\r\n\r\nOp de school van het agentschap van het Indianenreservaat van de Mohaves verwierf Ten Kate vier kleine aardewerken bustes van mensen, vervaardigd door een Chemehuevi-meisje, Topilla genaamd, dat duidelijk artistiek talent had. Het is onduidelijk of de ceramieklessen waarin deze waren gemaakt onderdeel waren van de conventionele handenarbeidlessen van het reguliere schoolprogramma of dat deze lessen werden georganiseerd vanwege de sterke aardewerktraditie van de Mohave, een traditie die later door de Chemehuevis werd overgenomen. Topilla's naam staat onder in een van de beeldjes gekerfd, misschien op voorstel van haar lerares, maar mogelijk ook van Ten Kate. De Paiutes maakten al heel lang kleine aardewerken beeldjes die gebruikt werden als kinderspeelgoed." .
