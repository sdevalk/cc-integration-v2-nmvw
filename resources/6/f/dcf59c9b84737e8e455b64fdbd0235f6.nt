<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/IB2020-8-1> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Tupaia's scene in Tahiti is fascinating, not because it is an engaging representation in a European style of canoes, bearing warriors, a long open house and a number of plants and trees.But because, like his drawings of marae, it seerns to embrace the descriptive documentary interest in Tahitian life, characteristic of a scientific traveller such as Joseph Banks. Polynesian art embraced many genres, styles and ideas, but typically it exemptified sanctity, spiritual power and social reach, in the sense that a work of personal adornent might incorporate rare feathers or shells that could only be obtained from afar. One thing Polynesian art had never done was describe things, but in this work and in\r\nothers, Tupaia did precisely that, drawing attention to the key elements of canoes and the manner in which during the course of a confrontation, they would be brought together so that warriors on raised stages could attack each other. He also depicted the structure of the typical form of the  elongated open houses within which people gathered and slept and he drew attention to the useful flora of Tahiti, in particular to the Pandanus tree, with its structura of exposed roots, the coconut palm taro and the breadfruit tree. \r\n\r\n(Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts,p.285)" .
