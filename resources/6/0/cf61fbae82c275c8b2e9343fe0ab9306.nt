This Dreaming is implicitly linked to the pigeon totemic ancestor.\r\nThe small black circles depict the seeds. The central circle with meandering lines represents the place where the pigeon was born and the travelling tracks across the country. The tracks lead to other significant places connected to this Dreaming. These are depicted in the other circular designs in the painting. The artist has also depicted women traveling the country in the symbolism id the crest shape. The dreaming occurred at Kunalaryinu in the Northern territory." .
