Het ronde dikke gedeelte van de trompet besneden over de gehele rondte, spiraal,visgraat, vierkanten en driehoeken.\r\n\r\nThe flutes of the Lake Sentani district can be divided into two mains groups, those blown at the open and those with a hole at the side. The former group included pipes of three lengths: those as long as a man's arm, the middle size flutes of the length of the lower arm, and the short ones the length of man's hand. They were sacred objects kept in the men's house. \r\n We know many things on the bamboo sacred flutes which were, according to P. Wirz (quoted in Kooijman and , 1992, 84), imported  from the Humboldt Bay villages around the turn of the 20th century, sometime after introducing the mau (men's house) into the eastern lake area. Yet, in 1903, when Sande visited the region he did not see any bamboo flutes. He collected wood flutes which look like this one but he did not write anything on their use." .
