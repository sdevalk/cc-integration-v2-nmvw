<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7158-375> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This poster features the OM symbol prominently. In Hindu cosmogeny, the universe is created through a sacred sound, OM. It is therefore the primordial utterance. The word has become ubiquitous through contemporary new age religious traditions and yoga practice, and you can find it on t-shirts, fridge magnets and key chains. The OM sign is considered to be particularly auspicious.\r\nIn this poster the OM is surrounded by the words Hare Krisna Hare Ram. These are sacred utterances: they connote devotion to the god Krisna. The idea that simply reciting the name of a god is an act of devotion can be traced back to Chaitanya, a Bengali saint from the 15th century who would ecstastically wander and recite the name of Krishna out of his pure devotion. His views on Krishna devotion helped to form ISKON, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (known more commonly as the Hare Krishna movement).  This object is therefore a wonderful example of devotional Hindu practice (known as bhakti). Bhakti in Hinduism is all about access and a devotional relationship to the deity. Posters like these are accessible and widely circulating symbols of devotion." .
