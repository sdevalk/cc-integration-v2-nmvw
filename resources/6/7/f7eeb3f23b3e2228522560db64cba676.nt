<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/75a3b4c6681c9c1de14d6d4c702df89d> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "According to the description of this object on the museum card it is one of the two side pieces of a dancing beam. It is an ornament from carved wood. There are three parts to it: a disc in the middle and above and below it there are openwork carvings. The disc has a whole in the middle and a star painted around it. The upper end of the ornament has the shape of a fish tail. The lower end is a little smaller in diameter than the rest of the middle wooden bar and serves as a stud. It also has a hole in it. The ornament is coloured red and has white and black paintings on it. \r\nAccording to the card the two side pieces were stuck into the ends of a dancing beam. When the beam was set into oscillation by the dancing men, the end pieces started swinging too.  There was no information at all on such end pieces in the literature about dancing beams, so the only information comes from the museum card. \r\nThe dancing beam was a long beam of wood which was laid on two or three posts in front of the men's house. It was decorated with carvings along the sides and had adorned ends, often in the shape of a crocodile's mouth. The leading men of a clan would dance on the beam during dancing ceremonies. It is not known, what the meaning of the beam or the act of dancing on the beam was. As it was quite dangerous to dance on the beam due to its thin surface, it was considered prestigious and challenging. \r\nThe beam also used to be part of remembrance ceremonies, where the skulls of deceased persons would be tied to it.\r\n\r\nThe objects 2802-94a and c belong to this item." .
