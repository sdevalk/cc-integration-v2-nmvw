Op eencder zijkanten een slijpvlak.\r\n\r\nThe rocks used to make the axe blades come from the Cycloop Mountains. In 1903, when Sande visited the region, people from Asei went themselves in the Cycloop Mountains to take rock. Such an excursion, there and back, could be done in one day.  The block of stone (20-30 kg) was transported by two men with a pole. Only old men with experience could manufacture the stone. They held the stone in the left hand. In the right one they have a piece of an old stone hatchet as a hammer, tsé weri. Roughening, weri woi, of the rough adze, tsé, could take several weeks. The axes were polished sometimes by the children on a slab, sedere, at the lake’s edge. Then these shining axes, tse jai, were exchanged. The blades value is based essentially on the translucidity of its sharp edge. The most expensive ones are these which have a personal history made by their travel from hand to hand.\r\nIn spite of the diffusion of the iron axes, the production and the exchanges of stone blades continued until today even if people do not exploit the quarries since the 1980s’. They were and are used in exchanges and for bride wealth. Some of them were found in the Moluccas (to 1800 km from Cycloop Mountains).\r\nStone blades were also produced by people from Sageisara and Ormu villages in Torare valley. Ormu people distinguish two kinds of rock, arowai (dark rock with blanc crystals, common)and fenefu (light rock from yellow to green, noble and reserved to oldest lineage). In the beginning of the 20th century, arowai was used to make marriage axes, whereas fenefu was mainly used for tree cutting axes and sago adzes. It is difficult to distinguish these two kinds of  blades because the two rocks are used and the proportions are the same. In the past, the productions of Ormu and Sentani Lake reached the whole district thanks to the numerous exchanges. People from Sentani Lake obtained Ormu axes with their beads and glass rings which have high value. Three kinds of exchange exist: direct exchange between individuals, collective and ceremonial exchanges between groups of people, and exchange between chiefs. Given the time necessary to produce axes, the thousands of axes exchanged today and the archaeological studies of old villages (157 BC to 69 and 452 to 635) where no axes were found, the authors supposed that broken wood work axes were always recycled to be exchanged since these times." .
