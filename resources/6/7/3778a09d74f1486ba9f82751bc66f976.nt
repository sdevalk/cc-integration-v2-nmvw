Floor coverings were essential to everyday life in traditional Korea. \r\nThis mat is called hwamunsok made of sedge. It is decorated with characters symbolising happiness and geometric patterns which are not decipherable. Its delicate technique and patterns imply that it probably was used in summer by a noble family.  This mat has Chinese chracters 'su' and 'bok' in stylised symmetry and two pairs of phoenixes. Clouds patterns are also found.  In the centre of the mat, nine figures are noticeable. They look like the eyes of the phoenix. Since seven or nine chicks of the phoenix are very often depicted as well as a pair of phoenix as a symbol of the happiest family, these patterns are probably chicks. \r\n\r\nIt is said that scholars and men of noble birth spent many pleasant hours on their hwamunsok. By the middle of the Choson period, the demand for the mats among scholars and officials was so great that 271 artisans were assigned to the Seoul crafts office, 8 to the Kyonggi-do crafts office and 28 each to the Cholla-do and Ch'ungch'ong-do crafts offices. \r\n\r\nKangwha Island, off the west coast just a couple hours drive from Seoul is regarded as the producer of the finest quality mat. Sedge called wanggol, an annual with remarkably smooth and shiny stalks, grows all over the island. \r\n\r\nHwamunsok weaving is a complicated process requiring many hands. For the smaller mats measuring 1-1.5 meters across, two people at least are required. A 1.5-2.41 meter mat requires three weavers, a 2.4-3 meter mat, four, and a 3-3.6 meter mat, six. One mat usually takes five days to weave. \r\n\r\nThe hwamunsok of today differ from the hwamunsok of the mid-Choson period, however. During the Choson period the mats were made of cb'amgol, a variety of sedge that is more durable than the sedge used now, and their edges were bound with fabric strips. Today, hwamunsok are made from the outer layer of sedge grass, and the decorative designs have changed to suit modern tastes." .
