I got on its back, but\r\n       it refused to move, I kicked it, but it did not stir. Then I\r\n       took the whip and hit it angrily. As soon as it felt the low,\r\n       it neighed with a sound like roaring thunder, spread out a\r\n       pair of wings, and flew off with me.\r\n2)   [T] Arches France &\r\n3)   [B] Arabisch schrift in spiegelbeeld" .
