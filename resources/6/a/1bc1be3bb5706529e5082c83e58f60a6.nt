The design could indicate for whom the use of the comb was intended, for example combs with the obah n’uhi, or infinity symbol, would have been used only by members of the royal court. \r\n\r\nOyiya in Benin were historically carved from wood or, in the case of more elaborate examples, ivory. They are usually long and thin in form, with wide-spaced teeth. In some cases, the handles are carved simply, whereas in others they feature elaborate motifs and decorations, such as figures of horses and riders. Combs would have had a functional use, to comb and plait the hair, allowing it to be dressed and styled." .
