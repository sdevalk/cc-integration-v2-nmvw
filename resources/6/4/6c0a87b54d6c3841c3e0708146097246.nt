<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7210-1> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This carpet brings together two important aspects of Iranian culture in the twentieth century: carpet production and the Pahlavi dynasty. It is a high-quality silk carpet produced in Tabriz by the well-known carpet family Nizami Doost in 1974. The image on the carpet reproduces a photograph of the Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (1919 â€“ 1980). The carpet was likely produced as an official gift. Tabriz has been a centre of carpet production since the Safavid dynasty ruled from the city beginning in 1501. Carpets produced in the region were coveted on a global scale and traded around the world." .
