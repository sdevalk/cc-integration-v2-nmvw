It is wrapped with bands of colored cotton and felt, tied by native cotton string. Traditionally the core of the head ring consisted of willow bark, or sometimes a bundle of thin twigs, wrapped with bark of other soft fiber. These head rings were worn by women for carrying water jars and other burdens, including cradles, as well as for softening the impact of the head strap used to carry loads on their back (cf. Spier 1955:7-8). A note by Ten Kate indicates that he saw these rings as being worn by old people.\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)\r\n\r\n\r\nHoofdband van oude mensen. Van zwarte wol met stroken rode katoen en met wit katoenen snoer omwonden \"Koeraäka- hapig\"." .
