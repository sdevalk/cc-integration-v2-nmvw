It is decorated with pigment, coix seeds and abrus pips. Bunches of fibre strings are attached to the two front legs and the left behind leg. At the right rear leg only few fibre strings are left. Behind the front legs the body has been pierced both horizontally and vertically. This figure was collected during the imo ritual in Okaba.\r\n\r\nCrocodile is the main totem of the Bragai-ze-ha clan of the Bragai-ze phratry which connects the phratry with the mayo-rites and originates from the fallen ritual pole. His sister is Ualiwamb, a betel woman. The crocodile image is often depicted on the central post of the feast house, e.g. in the Upper Bian cult celebration.\r\n\r\nIn Marind mythology there is a great variety of stories connected with a crocodile.\r\nAccording to one myth, another crocodile, Ugnemau \"changed into a sago tree, which in its turn becomes a crocodile, Mangu\" (Van Baal, 1966: 373). \"Mangu is the igiz-ha, the real name, of the crocodile\" (ibid.: 378). Later on, Mangu gets the name Mongumer-anem, the crocodile dema, \"who later turned into a betel palm\" (ibid.: 180).\r\n\r\nAnother myth narrates about a mythical crocodile, which is one of the most preferred appearances (metamorphoses) of Ugu, the son of a mythical sago-maker Harau (Mahu-ze dema), who is the originator of the female hairdo. His father Elme gave him the name Ugu (skin). Ugu became the first medicine-man (messav) because he knew extraordinary tricks. Thus all magic derives from him. Like a crocodile, Ugu came to be feared by everybody and as a result of that he was killed. His body was roasted and eaten and all the boys who just try a piece of Ugu's meat became a medicine-man. Ugu's skin was preserved because it was very precious for the local people (ibid.: 280-281).\r\n\r\nVan Baal notes that, according to Marind mythology, the crocodile's house \"is on the bottom of the sea and is full of cut-off heads. In his stomach are the coconuts thrown into him by Uaba, the sun dema\" (ibid.: 278).\r\n\r\nAccording to the Marind, a crocodile is a symbol of danger and adultery (since in myths he married many Geb-ze-ha girls) connected with underwater, underworld and magic.\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 28.11. 2006" .
