When they arrived at Kulpulunu they decided it wasnâ€™t a very nice place for a frog to live so they returned to Kamira.\r\nThe L shapes represent the two frogs. The two small lines represent the rain water running down into the  waterhole. The circle represents the campsite. This dreaming took place at a campsite called Kulpulunu near the Granites Mines in the Northern Territory of Australia." .
