Footraces were popular, often using a ball being kicked along cross-country, or along a specific track. Pimas competed against Papagos individually or in relay teams and the former were most often victorious. During preparations and training songs about bluebird and hummingbird, both associated with speed, were sung, and dancing took place. Women played a kind of shinny with willow sticks and a pair of balls, tied with a six inch leather thong.\r\n\tThe balls for these games were made of mesquite or paloverde (Parkinsonia) wood or stone, and covered in a layer of black creosote (Larrea tridentata) gum. The stone cores measured 3.5 to 6 centimeters in diameter, but the wooden balls were the size of croquet ball. While the wooden balls were manufactured by the Pimas and Papagos themselves, the stone balls were found at prehistoric sites of the Hohokam, the ancient occupants of the area. These are believed to possess magical powers and giving the runners physical strength (Whittemore 1893:64-67; Russell 1908:171-174,284; Bahr 1983:191).\r\n(Hovens 2009)" .
