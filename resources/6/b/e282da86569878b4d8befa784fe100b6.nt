It was used to prepare and to serve sago-porridge.(Sande, 1907, 11) The preparation of the dishes took place in the houses and were the duty of the women (Sande, 1907, 8).\r\nThe support for pot is made of strong strips of rattan twisted out.\r\nIt was lashed transversaly with the end of the strips at a single pot (see 3600-7644a). It intended to be placed under globe-shaped pot to prevent their fall. It is manufactured by men. (Sande, 1907, 26) As the ordinary pots are all of the same size, the rings which come from Tobati are of the same width as those met with on Lake Sentani. The heigth is such that the pot is supported all around and the bottom remains free from the floor. Those which come from private houses, appear to be the property of the women, at least at Asei the persons, who wanted to deal with Sande in these articles, mowda, were women. (Sande, 1907, 11)\r\nIn Tobati it is called muda (mura) or medjua. (Sande, 1907, 26) These support are only plaited in Asei (Pétrequin, 2006, 417). Each village of Lake Sentani is specialize in on specific production. The exchanges between them compensate for the unequal wealths sharing out (Pétrequin, 2006, 417).\r\nTwo french ethno-archaeologists have studied the different techniques used in New Guinea for the production of ceramics (A.-M. and P. Pétrequin, 1999 and 2006). All the earthenware pot used to stock, prepare or seve sago are exclusively manufactured in the village of Abar (Pétrequin, 2006, 417). Men make only small pot for the lime (Pétrequin, 2006, 417). \r\nThe female potters use an original technique : ceramic manufactured without bottom. They use small flat section ring colombins of red clay stick by the interior of the pot. Stone and wood bats are used at the end of the manufacturing to make disappear the colombin traces(A.-M. and P. Pétrequin, 2006, 420-421). The sinuous ribbon decorations (the serpent sign in Abar) is stuck then. The following day they close the pot bottom. After drying during one day the pots are baked one by one thirty minutes along. The pots are the exchanged by the men especially with people coming from Ormu-Wari who give them axe and people from Genyem basin (A.-M. and P. Pétrequin, 2006, 423).\r\nThe authors supposed that this technic (ceramic manufactured without bottom) could come from the Molucca.To support this idea the authors add that only people from Lake Sentani and Vanimo use wood forks to eat sago in New Guinea, like people from Moluccas do (Pétrequin, 2006, 424)." .
