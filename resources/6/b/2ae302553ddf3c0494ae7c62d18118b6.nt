Coal briquettes are put inside the stoves and lit up with combustive subjects such as paper, wood and solid alcohol. In China, the stove could be used as heating in winter combined with a long chimney (airpipe) that transports gas from the stove to outdoors and thus heating up the indoor area; it could also be used for boiling water, cooking rice or making tea. \r\n\r\nCoal briquettes are made in this beehive shape so they can be burnt more thoroughly. \r\n\r\nHannah Li, April 2019" .
