At times he either worked or vacationed on a vegetable farm at Gunn Point north of Darwin established by part-Iwaidja man. At other times he held short-term jobs in Darwin such as on the sanitation cart or stcking timber. In 1942 he was transported to Mataranka as a labourer for the Australian Army but soon made his way to Gunn Point and paddled across to Nguiu (Bathurst Island) in a dugout canoe.\r\n\r\nApart from short stints working as cleaner or kitchen-hand for the Army barracks or Air force base in Darwin, Minidji spent the remainder of his life living at Paru on south-west Melville Island across the Apsley Straits from Nguiu, the site of Cooper's old base camp. He was recognised by his colleagues to be a gifted carver.\r\n\r\nThe carving.\r\n\r\nMinidji stated this carving represents aliinga, a young girl of about thirteen whose breasts have just begun to appear. He has decorated the piece with traditional Tiwi design.\r\n\r\nThis piece was carved for Lance Bennett during one of his visits to Bathurst Island in 1965.\r\n\r\ncopyright Lance Bennett" .
