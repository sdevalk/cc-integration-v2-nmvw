Niwuda is van de Yirritja helft. Het schilderij is een hele verfijnde uitwerking van een traditioneel patroon, de geometrische precisie is voor Jimmy Wululu heel belangrijk. Het diamant patroon laat lege en volle bijencellen zien. De stippen zijn de bijen en de stuifmeel pollen waar de bijen op af komen. De macht van de Honing Geest wordt opgewekt door dit patroon. Hetzelfde patroon wordt geschilderd op de borst van deelnemers aan de Honing ceremonie en op het lichaam van personen die gestorven zijn en die verbonden zijn met de Honing Voorouder.\r\n\r\nYarrpany/Djalwarri - Dhuwa Honey\r\n(Wurrkigenydajarr, Marrngu People)\r\n\r\nIn N.E. Arnhem Land today people classify four (4) different types of honey. Three are of the Yirritja moiety; Niwuda, Milnhirri and Barrngitj. The fourth; Yarrpany, is Dhuwa. All bees belong to the Trigona species, Australian native bees, small black bees that look like flies and have no sting.\r\nEach type has it's own creation story. The Yirritja honey belongs to the Gupapuyngu, Gumatj, Mangalili, Birrkili, Balmbi an Dhalwongu people and is part of the Murryana; happy spirit story. Yarrpany belongs to the Rirarradjingu, Ngeimal, Datiwuy, Djambarrpuyngu, Marranguu, Marakulu, Gamalanga, Wagilag and Wurrkigenydjarr people.\r\nAt the beginning of time a Honey Spirit in the form of a man known by many names: Udal, Wuyal, Wandjuk, Mere and Mewal, came from the east. The name can mean just one man or can sometimes refer to a family group including women and children- they were the first people. They came from near Blue Mud Bay and jouneyed westward. They hunted as they travelled and left the language, songs and dances about their activities. They collected honey and then danced and sang to celebrate. Near  Blue Mud and Trial Bays in Marakulu country Wuyal cut a big stringybark tree (Gadayaka) to get the honey inside. As the tree fell it made a big depression in the earth which became a river. Mirriwa/Ngalkandji, a spirit man, heard the sound of the tree being chopped and raced to the spot to get some honey. However in his rush he got a splinter of wood caught in his throat. Running up a nearby tree he turned into a Frilled Lizard with his hoarse hissing voice.\r\nAt Raymingirr they cut down a tree which fell into the salt water of the bay and metamorphose into rock which can still be seen today under the water. The water bubbles up making it a dangerous place. At Walkumbimirri at the end of present day Ramingining's airstrip the Honey Spirits were dancing and cut down a tree which fell and formed a creek. As the tree was cut the wood chips flew hitting the countryside and creating waterholes one of which is Djapididjapin. The Honey metamorphose into long rock beds here which are riddled with holes and the Honey Spirit can be heard at night if you camp nearby. Some of the timber flew to Djimbi Creek where the road now crosses. Further along the creek the Frilled lizard Ngalkandji went into the ground with a splinter caught in his throat at a large circular rock pool called Ngalkandjibimirri. South of thre the Spirit Woman turned into a saddle shaped rock that looks like a Henry Moore sculpture.\r\n\r\nThe Marrangu people are also called Wurrkigenydjarr which literally means Flower (wurrki) power (genydjarr) - the flower of the Stringybark eucalyptus tree, the appearance of which heralds the onset of honey season. Although honey can be found all year round this is when it is in greatest abundance (Sept./Oct.). All things associated with the trees and honey are sacred: gecko lizards, forest goannas, the friar bird, marsupial rodents, the trees, the flowers, honey, pollen balls, yams found near the hive and of course the bees." .
