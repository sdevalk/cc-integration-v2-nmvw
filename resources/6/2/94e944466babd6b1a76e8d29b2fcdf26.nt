<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/8c58123fffa64a4cccc1783111ca75fc> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This picture depicts the Trail of Tears. The white government decided that Indians living in the east had to move to Indian Territory (present-day state of Oklahoma). Many people died during this march. \t   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis painting by Jerome Tiger depicts the infamous Trail of Tears when thousands of Indians were forced to move by the Indian Removal Act in 1830. The US government made Indian tribes move from the east to the west to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). Many people died because of disease, starvation and cold. The Trail of Tears is a recurrent theme in his work, although it is not necessarily this particular historical setting. It stands as a metaphor for the desperation people feel when they are driven from their homeland. More friendly examples of his work depict stickball-game players who show off their skill, strength and grace. The people in his paintings usually seem to float in the air and there is no or little indication of a background or surroundings. Tiger's style inspired and influenced many artists. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJerome Tiger was born in 1941 in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. He went to the Cleveland Engineering Institute in Ohio after his schooling in Eufaula. After his return he was encouraged to make a career out of painting by his grandfather who told him to 'put on paper what Indians have in their heart'. He became a successful artist and won several awards. He died in 1967 during a shooting accident." .
