<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/aafc922de7fddb4331b77c584d2570cc> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "In the immediate aftermath of the Soweto Uprising, Gavin Jantjes was shocked by the lack of understanding of apartheid in Europe. Both `Freedom Hunters' (7246-1) and `No More' (7246-2) were envisioned as a way of communicating the horrors of apartheid to foreigners. Both works are screen prints on top of collages made from photos of the Soweto Uprising taken by South African photographers Peter Magubane and Sam Nzima. These photos, seemingly cut out of newspapers and magazines, gives the works a strong sense of a breaking news story about South Africa as the artist might have experienced it while living in Europe. In addition, the works incorporate poetry by South African poets in exile. The composition of the works serves not only to educate a European audience about apartheid. But, by including images of protestors chanting and demanding liberation - and the violence they received as answer - it served as an urgent call to action. Today, these works can also be seen within the context of Black Lives Matter and continue to resonate in the global struggle against systemic racism.\r\n\r\nGavin Jantjes' works, including 'Freedom Hunters' which is one of his best known and most studied works after `South African Colouring Book' was highly influential on the British Black Art Movement, and contributed to a greater understanding of apartheid abroad. As a result, his works form part of the collections of institutions such as the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African Art in the US, the Tate Modern and the V&A in the UK, the Hermitage in Russia, and the South African National Gallery. His works have also been exhibited as part of a collection of anti-apartheid art in the Parliament of South Africa for a period of three years.\r\n\r\nThe Soweto Uprising started on 16 June 1976 as a peaceful protest by schoolchildren against the apartheid government’s introduction of compulsory Afrikaans language education in black schools. Police responded by opening fire on the children, killing many, including 12-year-old Hector Peterson. There is no definitive account of how many people died in the uprising, but it could be as high as several hundred. The Soweto Uprising marks a turning point in South African history. \r\n\r\nThe white minority government of South Africa had been relatively successful in shutting down dissent in the 1960s following the imprisonment of most of the members of the anti-apartheid movement including Nelson Mandela. It was also able to maintain its international support from the US and the UK in the context of the Cold War.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Soweto Uprising in 1976, images of the carnage inflicted by the white police circulated internationally. The most famous of these photos was that of the 12-year-old Hector Peterson, who had been killed by police. In the photo he is being carried by a bystander while his distraught sister cries in anguish. As a result of international outrage following the massacre, South Africa became a pariah state and was increasingly isolated from the global community. Internally, the Soweto Uprising led to sustained resistance against apartheid by the radicalized black South African youth. These two factors contributed to the eventual failure of the apartheid system which forced the white minority government to negotiate with the anti-apartheid movements, including the ANC party, and eventually resulted in a peaceful transition to democracy in 1994. Today June 16th, Youth Day, is a South African national holiday." .
