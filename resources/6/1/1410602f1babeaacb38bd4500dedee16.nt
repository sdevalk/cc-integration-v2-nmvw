This is a symbol of Hanuman's undying loyalty and love for Rama and Sita. \r\nHanuman, Rama, and Sita are the protagonists of the Ramayana epic story that is hugely popular in South Asia, its diaspora, and in localised forms throughout Southeast  Asia.\r\nHanuman is a loyal devotee of Rama's who helps to rescue Sita (wife of Rama) from the demon king of Lanka, Ravan. He is a monkey god and has been, throughout history, depicted with varying levels of simian features: in this poster, he is more monkey-like, as we see he is furry, and has a tail. In visualisations of Hanuman in the 1980s and later, he sheds his fur and reveals smoother skin, and is often depicted as muscular, like a body-builder or athlete. Hanuman is therefore associated with masculinity and virility in the contemporary context." .
