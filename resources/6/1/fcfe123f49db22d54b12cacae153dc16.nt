<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/a15a7b7bad33b7fa67c06305eb1a06c9> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Some manufacturers of guitar/synthesizers wanted to eliminate the tracking and latency problems associated with guitar-based systems, while retaining the expressiveness of the guitar. They achieved this, to some degree, by redesigning the instrument part of the human-machine interface so that it was better suited to driving a synthesizer. The 1980s-era SynthAxe was a futuristic controller consisting of a fretboard attached to the body at an obtuse angle. The fretboard strings were used to indicate pitch and sensed string bends. A separate, shorter set of strings were used for picking and strumming. These triggered the notes fretted on the fretboard's strings. It also featured trigger keys which could be used instead of the trigger strings. A whammy bar was assignable to any MIDI parameter. The SynthAxe was prohibitively expensive and therefore not widely used.\r\n\r\nYamaha originally entered the market with a guitar-like MIDI controller called the G-10. It was considerably less expensive than the SynthAxe. The G-10 had two assignable knobs and an assignable whammy bar and it used six strings, all the same gauge [thickness], which sensed both right- and left-hand input. The fact that the strings were all of the same thickness made the instrument feel substantially different for a player, in contrast to the typical guitar, and may have hindered the instrument's acceptance. Both the SynthAxe and Yamaha G-10 were later discontinued.\r\n\r\nStarr Labs' Ztar is one of the few remaining guitar-like controller product lines still in production. A Ztar differs significantly from the SynthAxe and Yamaha G-10 in that the \"fretboard\" is covered with keys, not strings. Keys in the same row can trigger notes at the same time. This has no analog on a real guitar. It would be as if a single string were polyphonic. A number of variations are available, including an instrument that uses strings for strumming or picking, to trigger notes, whereas the pitch of the notes is determined by the keys that cover what would be a \"fretboard\" in an ordinary, stringed guitar.\r\n\r\nYamaha have re-entered the market with a simple midi guitar (EZ-AG) that has illuminated frets to teach finger technique and 20 voices.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the guitar-like MIDI controller systems are that the tracking [the speed and accuracy of the notes the instrument produces] is much better than guitar-based systems, which means that there is no noticeable latency. As well, whammy bars and other controllers can be assigned to any MIDI function, which gives the performer more on-stage control of their sound. The disadvantages for guitar players are that the controller is not a guitar, and neither does it feel exactly like a guitar nor make guitar sounds. As well, they are expensive, and their rarity may make it difficult for performers to repair or service them.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar/synthesizer#Guitar-like_MIDI_controllers (22-7-2009)\r\n\r\n<STRONG><a href=\"http://collectie2.wereldculturen.nl/othermedia/Audio/AUD000142.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Beluister de gitaar.</a></STRONG>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .
