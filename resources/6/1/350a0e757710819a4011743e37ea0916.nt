<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/WM-67511> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Washbasin and stand\r\n\r\nEnamel washbasins were a type of common household appliances during the planned economic period in China (approx. 1949 - 1978). They can be used for multiple purposes, e. g. cleaning, dressing, washing vegetables, clothes etc. Enamel objects, due to their relatively cheap prices and aesthetic, colourful decorations, became popular. They were made locally and widely available. \r\n\r\nThe washbasin stand originated from the dressing table, while the inclusion of the washbasin shifted its purpose to cleaning rather than grooming.  Besides holding the washbin, the stands usually have a soap holder, a towel holder, and sometimes a mirror. It was a standard object for an office setting, alongside spittoons and thermos bottles, serving for establishing hygienic habits. Hot water from a thermos would be poured into the basin and a wet towel would be used to wipe the body clean. \r\n\r\nHannah Li, April 2019" .
