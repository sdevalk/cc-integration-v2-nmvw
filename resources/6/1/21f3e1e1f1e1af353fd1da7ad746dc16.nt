High above the northern Arizona desert near the village of Polacca, rises the mighty escarpment known as the First Mesa. Here, atop the natural fortress, was built the Hopi village of Walpai some six centuries ago.\nThe Niema, sometimes called Hemis, are shown in this painting of the Home Dance. They blacken their bodies with soot, scribe simple designs in white, and wear a wreath of Juniper sprigs, turquoise and silver jewelry, and a fox pelt behind. The ceremonial apron ans sash, fringed moccasins and arm bands complete the basic costume. Masks are changed for different ceremonies," .
