Het voorwerp is beschadigd. Wordt gedurende de Corroboree-dansen in de grond geplaatst. \r\n\r\nYengorimarra, symbol; placed in the ground during Corrobboree. Being a vertical stick, to which are fastened two crossing laths, whereon human hair is wound in a sixside figure. Gnalluma-tribe, Sherlock-district.\r\n\r\nThe maître de cérémonie, sitting crosslegged on the ground, a \"yenjorimarra\", standing in front of him, and surrounded by the other singers and musicians, work himself into a regular state of frenzy, as each dancer in his turn dances for about a minute before him, stepping from right to left and left to right, with every muscle of his arms and chest quivering and shaking as if shivering with the most frightful cold, whilst the arms are held almost rigid.\r\n\r\nThe best \"quiverer\" is considered the best dancer. Whilst each dancer performs thus before the maître de cérémonie, the others continue their stamping, and when every one has passed him and his musicians, they utter another frightful yell and leap back into the outer darkness, vanishing as quickly as they have appeared.\r\n\r\nAfter three weeks, when a perfect healing has taken place, another large Corrobboree is held, edible seeds of every kind are placed before them by the elders, and touching these with their hands, it is intimated to them, that henceforth they are welcome to hunt in every part of the territory, where these seeds have grown.\r\n\r\nDuring this feast and ceremony the old women only are allowed to be present, and the candidate must not from this time forward touch the flesh of Emu or Kangaroo and in some tribes Bustard-flesh, until he has received a wound in a family quarrel or in battle with another tribe, or one of the elders rubs a piece of such meat over his mouth.\r\n\r\nThe \"yengorimarra\" and ornaments worn on this last occasion are at the end of the Corrobboree committed to the flames, and it was with great difficulty that the writer succeeded in securing a few specimens of the former." .
