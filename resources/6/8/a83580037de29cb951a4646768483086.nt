Short sides connected and have a seam.\r\nThe Baduy are a group of approximately 12.000 people, who live in west Java (Kanékés village, Kabupaten Lebak, Province of Banten, Indonesia). Their community is divided in the Outer- and the Inner-Baduy. The Inner-Baduy live very isolated, following strict rules.\r\nBaduy textiles have always been regarded as special by experts in Indonesian textiles. In the past there were very strict rules among the Baduy about the materials and the colours of their clothing (hand-spun cotton, mainly white and black/dark indigo blue). This can be seen in the clothing of a Baduy couple who form part of the collection of “klederdracht poppen” given in 1893 to Princess Wilhelmina by the people from Indonesia, when she was 13 years old (RV-1108-25 and RV-1108-26). \r\nThe contemporary textiles in this collection contain some additional colours and are also made with different techniques, even batik (7260-6). \r\nEspecially since 2000 these textiles are also made and sold outside the Baduy area, for example to tourists, but also Outer-Baduy themselves are sometimes wearing them." .
