She was one of the women who became engaged in the production of Pueblo storytellers. However, she expanded her range and also began to make Pueblo drummer figurines, probably influenced by her husband Bill Martin (Shayak’a, Hunter) who is a well known drum maker, storyteller and educator of Indians and interested Anglos alike. She produced a number of Indian percussionists with small wooden drums and drumsticks made by her husband incorporated in her clay figures. For a number of years they produced their own Christmas and New Year cards, illustrated with various drummers, designed by the couple and inspired by their work in clay and wood.\r\nMargot Spiegel visited Cochiti to meet Helen Cordero, probably the most famous maker of storyteller figures at the pueblo and credited with being the creator of this type in 1964. However she was not available or too busy at the time, and looking for other potters Margot met Mary Martin. Soon they became friends, united by their mutual involvement with the earth, creative ideas, expressed in pottery. On a number of occasions they worked together, Margot assisting Mary in gathering the La Bajada clay for red slip and wild spinach to make black pigment, and during the process of firing storytellers.\r\nIn 1975 Mary learned making storytellers from her friend Dorothy Trujillo who originally came from Jemez but married Onofre Trujillo of Cochiti (Babcock and Monthan 1986:42). After making storytellers, singing mothers and nativities, she developed a unique type, frogs covered with little frogs listening to the stories being quacked (Spiegel-Kraemer n.d.:57). This type of animalito-storyteller became popular and soon turtle, bear, owl, and lizard underwent such transformation in clay in adapt Pueblo potters’ hands.\r\nMary and Bill have always been strongly involved with the cultural and artistic traditions of their people. Mary as a potter, and Bill as a drum maker and teacher of Pueblo language and traditions at various educational institution in and outside Cochiti.\r\nBill learned the art and craft of two-headed drum making from his grandfather, and he taught his grandson Ruben the elementary principles. He witnessed the growing separation between the youth and their tribal traditions, as modern society weaned them gradually away and made increasing demands on them. Watching TV and movies and playing computer games became favorite pastimes. The need for higher education and jobs necessitates them to move to urban centers. If they stay they become dependent on welfare and face poverty. Bill comments: “We’re trying to retain our culture, but this is very difficult. … When you lose the elders, many things go, like knowledge, like wisdom, the skills. … The challenge as parents is to integrate children into our culture. … There are no books that tell you which steps to follow. It takes a lot of things you learn from the people who take it from experience” (Ramirez 1995).\r\nPieter Hovens, 2015\r\n\r\nKatherine D.
