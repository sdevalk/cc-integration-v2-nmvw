This is evident from the fact that the word 'Jerusalem' is present on the metal cross, similar to how we might buy a mug or a magnet today with the name of a city we visited on it.\r\n\r\nAs is common still today, religious tourists to Jerusalem in the late 19th century bought souvenirs to bring home as gifts and mementos of their trip. By the second half of the 19th century, religious tourism to Jerusalm from Europe and America was booming, which also led to the enormous increase in vendors of souvenirs in the city. These vendors were so numerous that they filled hotel lobbies and some tourists remarked their annoyance at all of the souvenir sellers. Here are some recollections about the souvenir trade by 19th century travellers:\r\n\r\n'Jerusalem was beset by dealers in all sorts of relics; crosses of pearl and olive-wood, fruit-beads from Mecca, ear-rings of asphaltum from the Dead Sea, polished flint and petrified olives from the Mount of Olives and the Garden of Gethsemane, and small trinkets, manufactured of lead, from the Convent of St. Ceba. These relics, which are purchased in great quantities by the pilgrims, form an important source of revenue to the convents of Jerusalem.' John Ross Browne, 1851\r\n\r\n'I shall here add a hint or two in reference to Syrian hotels in general, and some Jerusalem ones in particular, in the hope that it may save travellers at least from disappointment, and possibly lead to reform. The proprietors have not a good name for strict honesty or honourable conduct towards their guests...They form conspiracies with dragomans, muleteers, curiosity-vendors, silk-merchants, and even with cicerones, to levy a tax from ten to fifty percent on every farthing that passes out of the traveller's pocket. It may be all very well to charge a rent to those who are permitted to encumber the courts and lobbies of the hotel with their wares, and to bore guests by an exhibition of their trinkets on the staircases and at the table; but it is nothing short of gross and shameful fraud to extort a large percentage from those who, at the special request of the traveller, bring articles to his own apartment for inspection.' John Murray, A Handbook for Travellers, London, 1858.\r\n\r\n(see Rupert L. Chapman, Tourists, Travellers and Hotels in 19th-Century Jerusalem: On Mark Twain and Charles Warren at the Mediterranean Hotel. London: Routledge, 2018)" .
