De lange hals is versierd met zaden die tot fraaie figuren zijn geschikt. De kop is voorzien van kam en snavel en eveneens met zaden versierd; onder de kop bevinden zich kijkgaten. Gebruikt bij rituele optochten en feesten.\r\n\r\nThis unique dema costume represents a cassowary bird, an important totemic ancestor/animal among the Marind. Its frame is made from light bamboo sticks. The lower part is completely covered with fibre of an aren-palm. The long neck is decorated with abrus and coix seeds which have been arranged into interesting motifs. The head is also decorated with seeds.\r\n\r\nIt was used during the ceremonies to represent Dawi, the cassowary dema. The dema-performer wore this costume in such a way that only his legs could be seen. In front of his eyes there are two holes in the costume so that he could look through them (Baal, J. van, 1938. Archive RMV, Leiden, RMV series 2385).\r\n\r\nCassowary (kai) represents the main totem of the Kai-ze clan of the Aramemb phratry and therefore kai is the main character of many myths within the rich Marind mythological corpus. \r\n\r\nThe origin of the first cassowary narrates the myth of one of Geb's sons - snake called Uaba. He and his wife Ualiwamb are found by Aramemb (main dema of Aramemb phratry) trapped in sexual intercourse. Aramemb frees Uaba while flames shoot from Ualiwamb's vulva (the origin of fire). From there also emerges the first stork (the symbol of the initiate) and the first cassowary (the symbol of fire). Cassowary is associated with fire in the way that fire is the main totem of Kai-ze (cassowary clan). Moreover, the fire dema is identical with the cassowary dema. \r\n\r\nWithin the imo initiation rites, the cassowary plumes form an essential part of the performers' decoration - sobolu. Each performer has his \"head covered with one half of the husk of a split coconut, painted red [referring to the bowl filled with blood from which novices must drink]. From the husk long, black cassowary-plumes, sobolu, hang down, covering up the performer's head\" (Van Baal, 1966: 613). The performer is called sobolu-ti (TM-number: 5969-48), the one with the cassowary plumes. \r\n\r\nCassowary feathers are widely used for various dema-performers' decorations, e.g. a broad crown of cassowary feathers (worn on the forehead of performers from Okaba) to which is fastened the gay shield representing the batend-bird. \"The batend-shield is an ornament worn by most dema-performers\" (ibid.: 643), including batend dema. \r\n\r\nThe cassowary dema played a very important role during the dema-wir (Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 9) celebrations. Wirz (1922-25 IV: 45ff) has described an elaborate dema-wir performance, organized by coastal mayo-group, which he observed during his first research among the Marind people (between 1916-1918);\r\n\"Among the performers we note first a hais, then a stork, then four gari-bearers. Now a yam dema appears, adorned with representations of the vegetable symbolized by him. A pigeon and a cassowary follow. The latter runs up to another performer who carries an obyara-tree, the fruits of which are the cassowary's favourite food...\" (Van Baal, 1966: 857).\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 20.11. 2006" .
