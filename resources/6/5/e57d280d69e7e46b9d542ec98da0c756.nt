This kind of dagger seems to be characteristic for the Admiralty Islands. Two ray-spines, which naturally have long rows of barbs on each side, are put into a wooden shaft each. The shafts are clearly separated and the joints coated with a layer of Parinarium putty which is painted with red and white rhomboid patterns. The handle is a male human figure with carvings all over his body. The carvings are coloured in white and black, while the rest of the body is red. On its head, the figure has a kind of board from which the shafts come out.\r\nThe dagger is used as a weapon in hand-to-hand fights at war or in a raid and could cause severe injuries. \r\nWarfare was one of the two areas in which the continuing vitality and power of a leading family or leading man were demonstrated. It was therefore crucial for maintaining the social hierarchy and can be seen as having been a normal aspect of life on the Admiralty Islands. The intensity and frequency of raids and fights probably increased after the arrival of Westerners, because they sold iron and weapons to the islanders which were firstly more effective and secondly produced an imbalance of power between the different clans. \r\nAmbushes or raids at dawn were frequent. The actual reasons or causes for attacks are not known, except that a leader would prove his strength and ability. The warriors were mostly young, unmarried adult men which were lead by a clan or group leader. They carried spears, javelins and daggers. All people in the attacked villages were killed, the eyes were gouged out with the sharp obsidian blades and sometimes the heads were cut off to be taken home as a trophy. Houses were burnt down. Fights were also decided on boats on the water." .
