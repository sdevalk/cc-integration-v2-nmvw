They are worn and sometimes dyed red by the women-- in a process held secret. Occasionally a diagonal pattern is produced by using a reserve technique (sigurit). Pairs of them might (silaplap) have mother of pearl or glass beads artfully sewn in between.  All are worn by men and women.\r\nBoth non-shamans and shamans complete their clothes by ornaments, in everyday life and especially during rituals. Men and women cooperate in the fabrication." .
