The diameter is round and the bowl has two semi-circled feet. The surface is polished with a checkering file and a pumice.\r\nThe handles are the tail and the head of a bird.\r\nThe carving of the bowls was the job of men.\r\nThe bowl was used as a dish for food, most likely soup. It was reserved for persons of high rank." .
