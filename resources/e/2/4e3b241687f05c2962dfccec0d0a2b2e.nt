<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1485-286> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This dagger has two parts. It has a wooden handle, into which an obsidian blade almost as big as the handle is stuck. The whole handle and the joint between handle and blade are coated with a thick layer of Parinarium. This way the blade is tightened and the handle can be shaped and adorned in the desired size and manner. The coat is incised with patterns, which are coloured white with lime. It shows a wavy motif on the broadest upper part of the handle near the joint. \r\nSplinters and bigger parts of obsidian, which were needed for the daggers and spears were hewn off with stones. This was done by expert men, who exactly knew the physique of the stone and therefore knew where to hit. Most of the blades were pear-shaped with the biggest lower part being attached to the wooden shaft. The shaft again has the same shape as the blade.\r\nAll the obsidian is originally from Lou Island, whose people were the first to have the monopoly on spears and daggers with obsidian blades. Through trade relations though, the obsidian also spread across to the main island and the little islands around, which then started to manufacture those weapons themselves. Deep shafts were dug out, in which men worked with torches to produce the obsidian. Big blocks of it were either directly processed on Lou island or traded to the other islands. In the period of 3,200 to 2,500 years ago, the Lou Island obsidian had been transported to places as far as Borneo in the west and Vanuatu in the east, covering a span of 5,700 km. \r\nThe dagger was used as a tool to cut things and as a weapon for hand-to-hand fights when it was actually used as a dagger. \r\nWarfare was one of the two areas in which the continuing vitality and power of a leading family or leading man were demonstrated. It was therefore crucial for maintaining the social hierarchy and can be seen as having been a normal aspect of life on the Admiralty Islands. The intensity and frequency of raids and fights probably increased after the arrival of Westerners, because they sold iron and weapons to the islanders which were firstly more effective and secondly produced an imbalance of power between the different clans. The warfare was prevented from the 1930s by the colonial governments. According to reports, the Admiralty Islanders did not hesitate at first to attack white people which were coming to the island. This was during the 18th century, when the English visited and chartered the islands and the existence of obsidian-tipped spears and daggers were reported then. This ceased as the islands began to be governed by white colonists. \r\nAmbushes or raids at dawn were frequent. The actual reasons or causes for attacks are not known, except that a leader would prove his strength and ability. The warriors were mostly young, unmarried adult men which were lead by a clan or group leader. They carried spears, javelins and daggers. All people in the attacked villages were killed, the eyes were gouged out with the sharp obsidian blades and sometimes the heads were cut off to be taken home as a trophy. Houses were burnt down. Fights were also decided on boats on the water. \r\nInterestingly, the designs of the daggers were adapted to the European market, which had a huge demand of weapons in the 19th and beginning of 20th century. Most of the weapons for European collectors and museums were collected between 1876 and 1910. The popularity of weapons can be ascribed to the reputation of the Admiralty Islanders as being independent and wild. On the other hand, Europeans were generally fascinated by weapons from societies they felt were still savage and primitive. Thus the prevalence of weapons in all the collections. The interest was for effective looking weapons, therefore the size of the actual blade was relatively big. This changed after 1910, when the main interest was for the adornment and decoration on the shafts. Consequently, the blades got smaller and the shafts bigger and more richly adorned. The Admiralty Islanders became skilled tradesmen and soon they purposely changed the design of the daggers so that it would match the European taste.\r\nThe daggers in this collection can all be ascribed to the first period which still had large blades." .
