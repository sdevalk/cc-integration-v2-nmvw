(without ties), w. 2 cm.; ca. 1880.\r\n\tThe multi-stranded necklace of blue and white seed beads on vegetal fiber totals almost fifteen meters in length if measured by individual strand. Beaded necklaces had a longer history among the Yumans than the collars, and were worn by both women and men. Reporting on his fieldwork among the Mohaves, Kroeber (1925:739-740) reported: \"They took to imported glass beads more eagerly than most Californians â€¦ Men as well as women coiled strands of blue and white venetian beads in thick masses around their necks; women wound them around their wrists; and donned showy shoulder capes of a network of beads. A definite style seems to have evolved early, which made use almost wholly of the two colors mentioned.\" The other neck ornament consists of opaque white and translucent dark blue seed beads applied in triangular designs on a woven fiber background." .
