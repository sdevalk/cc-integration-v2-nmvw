In Syria, these brass plates were hung on the wall at Christmas time in Christian households. The style of the figure is based on a relief of a soldier at the Achaemenid palace of Persepolis in southern Iran built around 518 BCE and it was meant to represent the Achaemenid emperor Cyrus the Great (600 - 530 BCE). The term 'magi' referred to a priestly caste in the Zoroastrian religion of Iran and so in various Christian traditions the three wise men are represented as Persians. During the 1960s and 1970s, images of the ancient site of Persepolis were popular in Iran and circulated widely. It is likely that they were readily available in Syria." .
