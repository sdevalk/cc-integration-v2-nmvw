<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/IB2015-26-7> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This type of cape was one of Naïma Bennis’s trademarks. Capes were originally worn in Moroccan society by men and in a very simple cut. This example made for a woman is nicely machine-made by someone who knows about pattern cutting. This is a particularly sophisticated example due to the cut of the hood. The decorations in metal and vegetable silk thread are handmade and characteristic for the type of Moroccan handwork called passementerie (couched plaited cord). The designs are ‘classic’ for Moroccan passementerie. This type of cape would have been worn over a kaftan or evening dress." .
