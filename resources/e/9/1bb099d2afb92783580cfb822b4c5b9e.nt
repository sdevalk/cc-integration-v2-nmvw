Over de breedte drie paren bruinrode en grijze strepen en op een zijde drie blauwe, op de ander een blauwe en een veelkleurige glaskraa  wordt op de borst gedragen. \r\n\r\nThis looped sting bag is called bilum in Melanesian pidgin.\r\nThey form a category of objects used daily  and are common almost over the whole of New Guinea. \r\nMackenzie noticed that even if the bilum is widespread in the whole of Papua New Guinea, in the majority of the lowland and coastal regions, it is not, and never has been the primary multi-functional artefact that it is in the interior mountain regions. \r\nThey are traditionally constructed from the interconnected loops of a bark fibres, hand spun into a virtually unbreakable two-ply string. Each bag is completed from a single string, as the maker, usually although not always a woman, alternately adds to the string by spinning more fibres against the thigh, and then uses the new length to construct further loops of the bag. \r\nThe universal and primary function of the looped string bag is as a container for transporting goods. In this respect large bags are most commonly associated with women, who use a large and expensive bilum in all their daily activities to carry the produce of their garden and their womb. Women could wear until five bilum. These are carried on the back and the sling is on the forehead.  Whereas men sling them over their shoulders. They contain men’s personal possessions and implement of daily life. Men, women and children may each have more than one bilum, of different styles and sizes according to the purpose. \r\nDespite the fast changing socio-economic conditions, bilum looping is an activity which remains integral to contemporary life in many regions of new Guinea. Introduced material as colourful yarns and extruded nylons are also used\r\nThus bilums express gender and social condition of their wearers. Sometimes they transcends their utilitarian function and become an embodiment of ritual potency representing cultural knowledge. They are also part of numerous myths which deal with female spirits who possess net bags.  \r\n\r\nThis kind of bilum belongs, according to Sande, to the smallest kind of men’s bags seen on the north coast to the east of the Mamberamno River. It is not carried on the shoulders as the other male bags are, but round the neck. It hangs down in front of the chest, sometimes with the sling tied to a separate neck string. \r\nThey were only used for holding tobacco and siri fruit. This bilum is made with a particular technique which seemed more valuable and is more decorated than the others. The name of the bag is linked to this method, and is srororo." .
