Not seldom however a fore shaft is introduced in between, and sometimes a special tip is fastened on to the arrow head. \r\nThere are several kinds of arrows depending on the use. They were used to hunt, to fish and to fight. \r\nBows and arrows could be deposited in the grave of its wearer after his death. At Asei, in the fence around a grave, the bow of the death man is stuck straight into the soil (See Sande, 1907, p. 271, fig. 166)\r\nSande noticed that arms were always carried when going outside the village, and the women working in the gardens were accompanied by men in case of an attack.\r\n\r\nFishing was done by the women who, if particularly skilled, were much sought after as marriage partners, even beyond their own district. \r\nSande detailed different kind of fishing, with arrows, with nets and with circular grates.  \r\nWomen also used boats, called kayi, to fish and also to access to gardens and sago swamps. The biggest could carry ten to fifteen women. They had carved ornamentation applied to their platform like a prow and were different from the men’s boats, named ifa. \r\nThe supply of fresh-water fish was supplemented by smoked fish acquired from people of the Humboldt Bay." .
