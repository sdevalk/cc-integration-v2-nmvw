Saraswati is considered the goddess of wealth, and we can see that this is symbolised through the gold coins that are flowing down from her body. Saraswati is considered a 'benign' goddess, meaning that her features are pleasant, and her divine acts are less destructive or powerful that goddesses that are 'terrible'. Both benign and terrible goddesses are considered ritually and religiously important and powerful, but they manifest their power differently. Saraswati is also what is known as a 'pan-Hindu' god, meaning that she is worshipped across South Asia and the diaspora. This is also true of Ganesha." .
