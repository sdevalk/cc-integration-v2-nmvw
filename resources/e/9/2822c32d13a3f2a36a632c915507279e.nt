Yet in daily life, clothes and ornaments are very simple. However, when social conditions are combined, and almost always during a public meeting outside of the village the situation changes. It is a matter of showing signs linked with the social membership, taking care of oneâ€™s appearance and exposing a part of the wealth acquired by exchanges." .
