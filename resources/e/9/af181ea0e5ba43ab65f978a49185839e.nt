At the upper end the skewers are glued together with a mass of Parinarium nut. The Parinarium is coloured with red from the mbuhul plant; it is decorated with carvings that show a crocodile's head, carvings coloured with lime white. \r\nWorn mostly by men at rituals and feasts as a decoration in the hair, sometimes used as part of the bride price for women.\r\nThe crocodile is a representation of the specific clan's ancestor and shows a connection to the spiritual world. The crocodile is one of the most important ancestral beings which created the earth and everything that is on it today. It is naturally closely associated with the water, which is considered the most important of the primal elements and in which the dead souls and ancestral beings dwell. The crocodile therefore represents an earthly link to the second world of the spirits, with which people constantly try to interact." .
