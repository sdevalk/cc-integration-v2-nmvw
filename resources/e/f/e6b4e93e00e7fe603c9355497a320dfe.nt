<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/082ac47d4ec2280a5d4832c46865d9f4> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "These three dance ornaments representing birds are very roughly carved out of very light wood. They have been painted white with chalk and decorated with black lines and dots. There is a hole through the middle of each object indicating that it was carried on a stick above the bearer's head. The flexible stick (arib) was put through the hole and attached to the performer's headgear or placed on a wooden platform (humum) worn on his head. \r\nThese bird-like decorations were carried by the waiko performers during the mayo cult dance - waiko-zi - connected with the re-enactment of some particular mythical episode during Marind cult celebrations. They are clan emblems representing totemic ancestors/birds. These examples are difficult to specify, therefore their particular bearers/dema-performers and their cultural symbolism derived from the myths cannot be determined. \r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 20.11. 2006" .
