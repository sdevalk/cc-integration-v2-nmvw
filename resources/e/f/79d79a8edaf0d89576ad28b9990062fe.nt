The Ursuline nuns in Quebec adopted Indian techniques and materials for their embroidery crafts in the seventeenth and eighteenth century. The nuns replaced expensive silk threads with locally available moose hair. They embroidered on both birch bark and cloth and sold it to support their missionary work. During the eighteenth century, the nuns taught this technique to French and British Canadian women and to young Huron and Micmac women. This trade slowly became dominated by Indian-made items. Other sources say that MÃ©tis-nuns learned this craft from their Indian mothers and brought this to the convents where it quickly was adopted by French nuns and established as an elegant, refined and 'French' form of needlework. Though moose hair is a difficult material to work with (the preparation of the hair takes more time than the stitching) it remained very popular, probably because along with birch bark, it was strongly associated with the Indians of North America. Indians kept providing these raw materials to convents throughout the convent phase of this art. Also, Indians were round this time viewed differently and many travelers and writers described them as 'noble savages' whose lifestyle was in many ways superior to that of the European (freer, easier, in harmony with nature). \tThis new view influenced souvenir wares as well. Also, by the 1790's, the British upper-class developed a taste for the exotic and curiosity collecting. The moose hair embroidered items represented the exotic to them: the Indians of North America and the French nuns. The French-speaking population was viewed with as much curiosity as the Indians.Like other tourist trade arts, moose hair embroidery decorated all kinds of household items. Decorations include floral designs and stereotypical images of \"Indian\" life. By the second half of the nineteenth century, the Huron became the most important suppliers of moose hair embroidery and the nuns gradually stopped making moose hair embroidered souvenirs. The work was particularly popular at major tourist attractions and urban centers. By the end of the nineteenth century, moose hair embroidery had gone out of fashion and it was no longer a profiting craft. From the seventeenth century on, birch bark containers and baskets from northern New England and the Maritime Provinces were traded to French missionaries and fishermen. These items were sent to Europe for display in curiosity cabinets. Birch bark (Betula papyrifera) is one of the most important raw materials of peoples in the Northeast Culture Area.  It is used to manufacture all kinds of objects ranging from canoes to baskets and covers for wigwams and longhouses. The bark is easily peeled from the tree in large pieces, rolled up and stored. Bark gathered in winter was preferred because of its extra thickness and deep brown color on the inside. While making baskets and canoes, the bark was always used with the dark layer outside. The bark was soaked prior to cutting to make the material more flexible. After that, the bark was cut, folded and stitched. Some of these baskets were decorated with (dyed) porcupine quills or moose hair. The gathering of the bark was done by the men; the women did the cutting and stitching. By the beginning of the eighteenth century Indian artists had begun to make more fancy wares for the souvenir trade. These objects were made in various Victorian styles to please a growing clientele. Chairs, purses and glove boxes were made and decorated along with traditional forms such as the makak, a maple sugar container. In the early twentieth century, this industry declined, due to an epidemic disease that killed off many birch trees. At the same time, there was less demand for quality work and artists were forced to make a living in other areas." .
