<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-362-64> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "362-64, 65\r\nQuechan woman's skirt, front panel; altahwahdeek (TK); willow; wool; w. 30 cm. (at top), l. 50-57 cm.; ca. 1870-1880.\r\n\tWomen's skirts usually consisted of separate front and back panels, the former being shorter and thinner than the latter. They could be made from strands of bark, plants fibers, woolen strips, and twisted yarn and cloth, but the inner bark of swamp willow seemed to be preferred. The strands of material were secured in a twisted cord that acted like a waist belt (Spier 1955:6; also cf. Spier 1933:95-96, plate IV; 1936:16; 1955:6; Gifford 1933:275; Trippel 1984:176).\r\n\tThis front panel of a woman's skirt consists of braided two-ply strands of black or dark brown wool, to which red flannel strips are attached as extensions and furnish a colorful fringe. The waist belt is made from heavy cotton two-ply yarn. This type of skirt became prevalent by the late 1860s when they replaced simple willow bark bustle skirts, and calico cloth was added to cover the upper part of the body (Trippel 1984:176; Tsosie 1992:38).\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvrouwenvoorschoot vele gedraaide snoeren aan een gordel bevestigd, ondereinden met lange strookjes rode wolstof." .
