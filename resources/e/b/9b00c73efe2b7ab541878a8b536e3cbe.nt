It has high sides. This basket has as decoration an open-work rim with triangles at the top. \r\nBasketry-making was the job of men. \r\nThis kind of basket was used as a bowl for storage or short-distance transport of plant food, especially fruit. These baskets without Parinarium coat are probably left unfinished, because Europeans liked them better." .
