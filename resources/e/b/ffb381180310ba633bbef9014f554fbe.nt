<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/4ae08b8115d00ce0b1ec91c5504c2d7f> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This wooden figure probably represents an ancestor or relative that recently died. It is carved from one piece of wood. Like all carving work, this was a men's job. \r\nIt shows a female figure which is halfway stuck in a dog's mouth. The hands hold the jaws of the dog. Both figures are coloured red. The human body has carvings all over which are coloured white and black. The head is relatively big and has big ears and a big mouth. The hair is tied up high. The arms are adorned with plaits. \r\nThe whole figure rests on a rectangular stud with which it could be stuck onto a roof beam. \r\nThe meaning of these figures is not quite clear apart from that they were always set up in men's houses. One can therefore assume that they represent deceased relatives or clan members. It is set up as a memory of the deceased rather than a resting place for its soul. The dog motif could be a reference to the clan's totem, to which the deceased has returned." .
