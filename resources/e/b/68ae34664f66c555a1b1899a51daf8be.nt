In their desert environment the Hopis hunted most small mammals as a source of food, for their skin, and as pest control, protecting their harvest. These included prairie dogs, rabbits, hares, raccoons, badgers, porcupines, foxes, coyotes and wolves. Communal hunts were partially a ritual affair, carried out during or in association with ceremonies, notably Maraw, Wuwuchim, and Niman. In such cases rabbit meat was secured to feed the eagles held captive for ceremonial purposes, and for feeding the people participating in ceremonies. On some of these hunts, girls went along to collect the animals. Such affairs were an ideal opportunity for courtship. During rabbit hunts each man took four of five projectile sticks along (Palmer 1878:311; Stevenson 1883:392, fig. 548-549; Bourke 1890; Dorsey and Voth 1902: plate 87,88,93,94; Beaglehole 1936:3-4,11-14; Devereux 1941; Ritzenthaler 1967).\r\n\tThe favorite and most effective weapon for killing small game was the curved throwing stick or club, either round or flat, and often erroneously referred to as boomerang (e.g. Parry 1872). However, the Hopi hunting stick does not return to the hunter. The Hopis called the flat type putc kohu (broad stick), rendered as peushkway by Ten Kate. Most were made of a naturally curved piece of scrub oak (Quercus gambelli; Hopi: kwi:'ngvi), but hickory, greasewood and cedar were also used. The flat type needed the most workmanship, and these rabbit sticks had carved handles, a pointed end, and were polished and partially decorated with painted designs. The designs at both ends are called ta'bo na'kab√º, meaning rabbit ears, while the short double stripes along the edges are the rabbit eyes, bo'shiadta. The rabbit stick was associated with Kih'sha, the hawk who hunted rabbits with it and carried the stick under its wings. The stick had the shape of the hawk's wing, and was presented given to the Hopis as a gift. By using a rabbit stick an animal could be killed without tearing skin or shedding blood. The offering of such perfect and undamaged animals war required in certain ceremonies (Parry 1872; Hough 1919:286-287, plate 44; Stephen 1936:99-100).\r\n\tSimilar round and flat curved sticks have been excavated at prehistoric sites in the Southwest, and it has been suggested that the type with longitudinal grooves was used as a defensive weapon against darts launched with an atlatl, and as a throwing weapon as well as in close combat. After the introduction of the bow and arrow, such war clubs changed their function and became hunting weapons, with carved handles (Parsons 1918:401; Stephen 1936:99-100; Heizer 1942).\r\n\tIn addition to the flat and curved rabbit hunting stick, the Hopis also used a straight throwing club of greasewood, round in cross-section, and about 60 cm. long, called makmorziko, for the hunt (Devereux 1941:66-67). Ritzenthaler (1967:104) suggests that these are a more recent type and came in use because they were easier to manufacture.\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)\r\n\r\n\r\ngebruikt bij de jacht op konijnen." .
