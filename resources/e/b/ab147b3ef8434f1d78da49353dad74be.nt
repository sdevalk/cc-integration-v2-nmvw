<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/2fc9e4cfac7deebd7eb2a78ef1433878> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Worked stone, possibly a palette; micaceous schist; Los Muertos or Las Acequias Ruin XIII, Hohokam Classic period; l. 10 cm.; A.D. 1150-1450.\r\n\t\"XII 1347 (?).\" Rectangular stone palettes, sometimes elaborately carved, were used in the cremation death ritual. Most had a lead oxide residue on their inner surface, suggesting that a change of color from white to red was desired in ritual. Palettes are usually made from schist or phyllite. Schist can be easily split into tabular pieces, than can be shaped into rectangular blanks. Early types are unworked flat stones of various shapes, but soon rims or borders were added to rectangular palettes. During the Colonial Period human and animal effigies were added as edge decoration on the slate-like schist, and the production and distribution of palettes is concentrated in the Hohokam core area. In the Sedentary Period production also takes place outside the core, resulting in distinct decorative patterns. The breaking of palettes and other artifacts is a custom associated with funerary ritual (Haury 1976:286-289: Krueger 1993; White 2004).\r\n(Hovens and Wilcox 2008-09)" .
