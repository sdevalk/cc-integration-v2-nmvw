This fan has 16 ribs, the colour of the paper is pale yellow. On the outer ribs, there are slips of wood attached. \r\nThere is no pattern on the handle. Its pivot is made of nickel. \r\n\r\nThe following is a brief description of how to make the hapjukson. \r\n\r\nThe selection of the bamboo was important in the beginning of the process of making fans. Fan-makers begin their work by carefully picking the most suitable materials. Bamboo stalks cut from about a month before and after the middle of the seventh lunar month of from the end of the ninth month until the second month of the following year were considered to be of the highest quality in terms of colour and resistance to insects. \r\n\r\nThe selected bamboo stalks are dried for a certain period of time, then baked over a charcoal fire to dway out the sap, which creates a luster to the stalks. Next, the stalks are split and carved into ribs.\r\n\r\nThe part that makes up the handle, or moksal, is thinly carved to leave only the bamboo sheath. Its two sides are then glued together with isinglass. Closely folded paper is pasted onto the prepared ribs, and then the rib ends and the handle are assembled and linked together with nickel pivots." .
