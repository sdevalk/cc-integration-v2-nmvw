<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/12db4eeb1956f8d2741b3452515cc991> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The 1912 Warbird portrait of Sac and Fox athlete Jim Thorpe (1887-1953) is a joined project by print artist Jacob Meders (b. 1977) and multi-disciplinary artist Jamison Chas Banks (b. 1978). The print is made after a photograph which portrays Thorpe at the 1912 Olympics in Sweden where he won two gold medals. He was the first indigenous athlete to win Olympic gold. As a child Thorpe boarded at the rigid Carlisle Indian Industrial School. There he played as a halfback for the football team. This team won every major football game against elite colleges across the nation, and had a major role in developing American football as a sport. \r\nIn this photograph used by Meders and Banks Thorpe wore different socks and shoes. On the morning of his competition, his shoes were stolen. However, he found two shoes in a garbage bin. One of the shoes was too big, so he wore an extra pair of socks. Wearing the different shoes and socks, Thorpe won two gold medals that day. Thorpe has been proclaimed on of the greatest athletes of the twentieth century. Meders and Banks honour Thorpe with their Warbird gold medal.  \r\nThe portrait is a screen print combined with a halftone letterpress print. Letterpress halftones were made by a photomechanical reproduction process, which came in to use from the 1880s onwards and ensured that images became widespread. From the 1890s forward photographic images were successfully incorporated alongside written texts in illustrated magazines. Thus, imagery of important events, such as the 1912 Olympics became widespread. The choice by Meders and Banks to go back to the letterpress halftones is therefore a deliberate choice. Even though the production process allows a higher print run, this print is 13/24." .
