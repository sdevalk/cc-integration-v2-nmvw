At the upper end, the skewers are glued together with a mass of Parinarium nut. The Parinarium is coloured with red from the mbuhul plant. The upper part with the Parinarium mass is decorated with incisions which are coloured with white lime, black coal and red mbuhul. They show a stylised human face.\r\nThis comb is used as a decoration in the hair and worn at special occasions. \r\nIt is worn mostly by men as decoration in the hair. Women sometimes wore such combs when in their wedding attire." .
