It is carved from one piece of wood, which was done by men. This leg consists of three parts, the cylindrical foot on which the whole figure rests, a male human figure and on its head a thick pin which is put into a whole of the bed frame. It is coloured black. There are two pairs and the two legs on a short side show the same motif. The beds were hardly long enough to hold the whole body, so people had to sleep with their knees up. \r\n\r\nThe beds were used as resting place, but also had a ceremonial function. It was used for weddings where the adorned bride was carried to her husband's house on such a bed. The bed was then part of the dowry. It is not sure whether sleeping beds and ceremonial beds had different designs or special motifs. \r\nDuring the day, beds would also serve as chairs and tables. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2802-95 1 t/m 11 op één kaart ; de maten van de slaapbank in z'n geheel L 187 cm, B 62, H 45 cm x?
