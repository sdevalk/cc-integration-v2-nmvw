It is carved from wood. The top is largely decorated with coix seeds and abrus pips. The eyes of the bird are also indicated by abrus pips. The beak, small head and other parts without pips have been painted yellow. There are a few real feathers attached to the body, mainly on the wings and tail. On the bottom there is a hole to which a stick was attached by means of which the ornament was carried above the bearer's head. \r\nAccording to the donor, children carried this object attached to a stick during the parade in honour of the marriage of Princess Juliana of the Netherlands.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\nThe bird ornament is a replica of the Basik-Basik clan emblem of the Bragai-ze phratry  representing a totemic ancestor/animal, whose ritual significance and cultural symbolism are rooted in Marind mythology.\t\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 28.11. 2006" .
