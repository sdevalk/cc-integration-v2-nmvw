The top is largely decorated with coix seeds and abrus pips. The eyes of the snake are also indicated by abrus pips. The parts without pips have been painted yellow with black, red and white dots. There are a few real feathers attached to the body. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \r\nAccording to the donor, children carried this object attached to a stick during the parade in honour of the marriage of Princess Juliana of the Netherlands.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t \r\nThe snake ornament is a clan emblem representing a totemic ancestor/animal, whose ritual significance and cultural symbolism are rooted in Marind mythology.\r\n\r\nUnud, a small and brightly coloured snake is possibly identical to a grass-snake, called mayo-iwag; the name resembles to mayo-mes-iwag, mythological women. Towards the end of the mayo-ceremony an effigy of 'snake-like' woman (Van Baal, 1966: 505), which is referred to as mayo-mess-iwag is ritually burned in the mayo-fire, and then symbolically eaten, referring to cannibalism. Paradoxically, the mayo-fire is the fire which plays the central role in the myth of the origin of mankind. The fire symbolically connects death and birth denoting Marind philosophy that from death springs new life.\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 28.11. 2006" .
