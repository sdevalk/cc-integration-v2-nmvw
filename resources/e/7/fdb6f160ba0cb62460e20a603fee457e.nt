<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1485-196> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This apron is made of plant fibres, white shell discs, beads and Pallaquium nut shells. There are different parts of the apron. The upper part is a plaited plant fibre belt, which has strings attached to tie it around the hip. \r\nThe biggest part is made of several width of cord with shell discs (shell money), in which dark beads are plaited to make a pattern. The bottom part are loose cords which again have shell money and nut shells tied to them for decoration.\r\nThe shell discs are also called shell money, because large amounts of them were used for trading, ceremonial exchange or were part of a woman's wedding attire. The large amount used for the apron are an indicator that it was valuable and costly and therefore mostly worn by chiefs or equally high-ranking men. Their value came from their difficult manufacturing process, which was the women's job. The small shells have to be drilled to make a hole in the centre. Then the top is cut off and the discs are polished. \r\nThe apron was worn specifically at dancing ceremonies. It was always worn in the front. They were not used for everyday-purposes." .
