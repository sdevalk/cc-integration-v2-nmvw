<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/TM-2670-548> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Sculpture is rare in the New Guinea Highlands. where artistic expression has famously focused upon body adornment, particularly involving paint and feathers, as well as on the looped string bags known in Tok Pisin (Papua New Guinea pidgin) as bilums, and on war shields. The Siane. however. did produce these essentially two·dimensional brightly painted boards, which were worn as a headdress or carried during performance, and displayed in large numbers by groups of men in major ceremonies invo\\ving offerings of pigs. Essentially stylised human-like images, they feature sun and moon imagery. Although virtually all examples in museum collections make use of imported paint, il is unclear whether boards like these were an innovation of the mid-twentieth century period. or had long been made.\r\n\r\n(Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts, p.302)" .
