The word literally means \"worthy one\" and constitutes the highest grade of noble person-ariya-puggala-described by the Buddha as recorded in the Pali canon. The word was used (as it is today in the liturgy of Theravada Buddhism) as an epithet of the Buddha himself as well as of his enlightened disciples.\r\nThere were sixteen arhats' names recorded in Buddhist canons, but the Chinese folks added two more into them so that there came the saying of Chinese Eighteen Arhats.  \r\nThe Emperor Qian Long of Qing Dynasty  stipulated the Chinese Eighteen Arhats and these rubbings seen here may be used for the royal stipulation of the Eighteen Arhats. \r\n\r\nAll the Chinese eighteen arhats are:\r\n1.\tPindolabharadvaja (3293-3)\r\n2.\tKan-akavatsa  (3293-4)\r\n3.\tKanaka-bharadvaja \r\n4.\tSuvinda\r\n5.\tNakula (3293-5)\r\n6.\tBhadra\r\n7.\tKarika   \r\n8.\tVa-jraputra (3293-6)\r\n9.\tSvaka   (3293-7)\r\n10.\tPanthaka (3293-8)\r\n11.\tRahula\r\n12.\tNagaena  (3293-9)\r\n13.\tlngata   (3293-10)\r\n14.\tVanav-asin  (3293-11)\r\n15.\tAjita  (\r\n16.\tCuda-panthaka  (3293-12)\r\n17.\tMahakasyapa \r\n18.\tMaitreya\r\nWe can distinguish the name of the arhat in each rubbing and there is also a brief description about their appearance and character.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arhats\r\nhttp://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BE%85%E6%BC%A2\r\n\r\nJing Tan, 2008." .
