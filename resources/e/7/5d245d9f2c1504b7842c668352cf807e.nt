<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7174-1> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This painting is immensely dense and varied, depicting all the cultural domains of Bali.\r\nMythical figures feature next to farmers, fishermen and market sellers, Hindu temples are seen next to a church and a mosque, and all these numerous scenes are photographed and filmed by the inevitable tourists, standing on their surf-boards, or leaning from the windows of helicopters or aeroplanes. There are many elements of humour in the painting.\r\nThe frame is carved by Wayan Bendi himself, with all kinds of scenes and figures." .
