<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1485-284> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This dagger is made from wood and ray-spine. This kind of dagger seems to be characteristic for the Admiralty Islands. Three bundles of two or three ray-spines, which naturally has long rows of barbs on each side, are put into three wooden shafts. The shafts are all together coated with a layer of Parinarium putty which is painted with white and black rhomboid patterns. It has red glass beads on top. The handle itself is shaped like a crocodileÂ´s head, whose mouth is broadened into an oval on top to hold the three shafts. \r\nThe dagger was used as a weapon in hand-to-hand fights at war or in raids and could cause severe injuries.  \r\nWarfare was one of the two areas in which the continuing vitality and power of a leading family or leading man were demonstrated. It was therefore crucial for maintaining the social hierarchy and can be seen as having been a normal aspect of life on the Admiralty Islands. The intensity and frequency of raids and fights probably increased after the arrival of Westerners, because they sold iron and weapons to the islanders which were firstly more effective and secondly produced an imbalance of power between the different clans. \r\nAmbushes or raids at dawn were frequent. The actual reasons or causes for attacks are not known, except that a leader would prove his strength and ability. The warriors were mostly young, unmarried adult men which were lead by a clan or group leader. They carried spears, javelins and daggers. All people in the attacked villages were killed, the eyes were gouged out with the sharp obsidian blades and sometimes the heads were cut off to be taken home as a trophy. Houses were burnt down. Fights were also decided on boats on the water." .
