Here, is he pictured with a flute, and a cow, because he is a cowherd. \r\nThe rise of devotional popular prints can be traced to the nineteenth century, when chromolithograph printing was introduced in India. These prints made it easier to reproduce and circulate images. The ways in which deities are depicted today were shaped largely by developments in this period. A combination of indigenous forms of depiction, coupled with European sensibilities around perspective, landscape, and beauty, influenced how deities were drawn. This is a strong example of the European ideals of soft facial features, as well as idyllic, pastoral landscapes." .
