The body would be painted, then buried swiftly in a grave carefully cleared of plants or roots, together with some implements and personal possessions, as well as plants frorn gardens maintained by the deceased. After the burial, a widow, together with other female kin would wear a kobbu along with other mouming garments and artefacts such as fibre armlets and leg-bands, their bodies rubbed with white clay, for the duration of a period of segregation and fasting.\r\n(Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts, p.309)" .
