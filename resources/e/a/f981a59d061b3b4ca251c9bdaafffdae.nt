These masks are most often associated with the powerful god Gomawe, and are characterized by their black patina and prominent noses. Depending on the region from which the mask originated, there are two main types of noses: a flatter, broader nose, and a protruding, curved nose (sometimes referred to as the \"beak style\"). In its complete form, the mask would have been adorned with a beard of human hair and a headdress surmounted by a mass of human hair cut from the heads of mourners. The masquerader was able to see through the crescent-shaped mouth, and usually wore a cloak made of pigeon feathers. The mask itself was painted black, which was the color applied to the bodies of mourners and symbolic of the roads leading to the land of the dead.\r\n\r\nEmily Caglayan, Ph.D.\r\nDepartment of Art History, The Graduate Center, City University of New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art" .
