It has a rectangular, almost square shape. \r\nWomen manufacture those bags. They start with plaiting the upper rim out of a palm leaf rip, which is split into several parts which are intertwined. The rips are split again into smaller strips, which are plaited into the desired shape of the bag. The two sides are closed on the bottom. Loose fibres are plaited into the bottom to create a fringe. \r\nThe bags serve to store smaller goods such as betel nuts, sago flour and taro roots." .
