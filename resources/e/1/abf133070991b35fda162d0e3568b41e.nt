Typisch voor deze periode is geringe lengte van het jak\r\n\r\nThis jeogori for a woman is a typical production of the 19th Choson period.  Jeogori was a basic coat worn by everyone in the Choson period. Around a Japanese invasion in 1592, the length of jeogori became shorter and shorter, compared to ones in the previous time. In the 17th century, it was from 60-80cm. In the following 18th century, it was about 45cm.  In the 19th century, 35cm, and lastly at the turn of the 20th century it became about 22cm. Along with this, the width of the sleeves was also becoming narrower in the late Choson dynasty. \r\nShort jeogori could not cover even breasts at all and narrow sleeves sometimes caused inconvenience when they were taken off. At the same time, a breast-tie was becoming shorter and narrower and the strips of cloth for trimmings were being emphasised. \r\nThe symplication of jeogori was to be fit for a big, decorous upheld hairstyle and a relatively wide skirt.  After the 1930-40, jeogori became longer again." .
