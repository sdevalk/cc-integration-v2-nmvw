In addition they had trumpets made from strombus shells, and bullroarers, probably used in ceremonies. They later adopted the basket drum and the three-holed cane flute from the neighboring Maricopas. Rattles made from gourds came in many shapes and sizes. After hollowing out a gourd and drying the remaining rind, a stick was fitted through it after putting small stones in it to produce sound. Many rattles were perforated \"to let the sound out\", the holes sometimes forming geometric patterns. In this case the gourd surface is perforated with tiny holes in a scroll pattern. Rattles were used as a rhythmic instrument in virtually all ceremonies, and during celebrations of social occasions (Russell 1908:166-170; Spier 1936:18; Underhill 1940:28; Di Peso 1956:421-424).\r\n(Hovens 2009)\r\n\r\nRammelaar in de vorm van een gele kalebas aan een ruw bewerkte steel." .
