In Syria, these brass plates were hung on the wall at Christmas time in Christian households. The style of the figure is based on a relief of the Achaemenid emperor Darius I at the palace of Persepolis in southern Iran. Darius ruled a large area of present day Iran from 522 to 486 BCE, long before the birth of Jesus. He is likely confused here with a king Darius who appears in the Book of Daniel in the Christian Bible and was also of Persian origin. The term 'magi' referred to a priestly caste in the Zoroastrian religion of Iran and so in various Christian traditions the three wise men are represented as Persians. During the 1960s and 1970s, images of the ancient site of Persepolis were popular in Iran and circulated widely. It is likely that they were readily available in Syria." .
