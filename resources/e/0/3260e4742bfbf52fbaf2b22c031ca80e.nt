Het blad is onversierd.\r\nKoreaanse waaiers kunnen worden onderverdeeld in twee groepen, te weten vaste waaiers (panggubuch'ae) en vouwwaaiers (chŏppuch'ae). De eerste groep bestaat uit een houten steel en een dun frame met daarover papier gespannen. De tweede groep bestaat uit twee stevige strippen hout met daartussen dunnere strippen waarover het papier wordt geplakt. Deze waaier kan worden ingevouwen en heeft soms decoratie op het papier maar is in veel gevallen wit of lichtblauw.\r\nVouwwaaiers hebben soms decoraties op de buitenste strippen, en de luxere modellen hebben een ornament of sŏnch'u, dat vaak van steen of geurig hout is gemaakt.\r\n\r\nKorean fans (puch'ae) can be divided into two groups, the first of which is that of non-folding fans (panggubuch'ae). These are made with a wooden handle and a thin frame that has paper stretched onto it. The second group is that of folding fans (chŏppuch'ae). These fans can be collapsed for portability and may have decorations on the paper and/or handle or a small pendant hanging from the handle.\r\nFolding fans consist of two thick outside guards that hold together a number of thinner sticks onto which the fan leaf is glued. At the bottom of the fan, the guards and sticks are held together with a rivet that often has a ring attached to it. This is used to string a cord through, so that the fan may be carried at the wrist. Basic samples have a white or light-blue leaf and may have decorations on the guard. More elaborate models also have a pendant (sŏnch'u) attached to them, consisting of a colorful piece of stone or scented wood with painted decorations.\r\n\r\nTwo types of paper fans were made in Korea: folding fans, and fans on handles.  People from the upper classes used to hold a folding fan not only for practical uses, but for part of apparel or symbol of status. Moreover, folding fans were made as works of art. Paper of pictorial or calligraphic rendering was often framed, made into a hanging scroll or incorporated in a folding scene.\r\n\r\nHow to make a folding fan is as follows.\r\n\r\n1. Selection of bamboo \r\n\r\nCut the best bamboo at locality, for example, Chonnam Damyang, Kurye region.  The cutting time is for one month from the 15th of July by the lunar calendar to before and after the Buddhist All soul's Day (July 15th of lunar month) and from the last day of September to the next February. During this time bamboo has not eaten by worm and sustain good quality.\r\n\r\n2. Cutting of bamboo \r\n\r\nCut all the joints according to the standard of Chupsun, usually 20cm - 30cm.  Then boil them in caustic soda and dry in the sunshine not to pile up.\r\n\r\n3. Setting ribs of Hapjuksun \r\n\r\nMake the skin of bamboo thin and peel cleanly at the round part of inside bamboo. Stick by two strips with fish glue made by boiling croaker's bladder not to come apart. Make a hole to drive in pivot after fixing by binding strips, side ribs and rim with a string to stick well not to tangle before pasting.\r\n\r\n4. Trimming and drawing \r\n\r\nTrim ribs before pasting to paper after handling with a sickle. Draw various figures as bat or chrysanthemum flower pattern. Usually use electric iron these days. \r\n\r\n5. Pasting ribs of fan to Korean paper \r\n\r\nStick trimmed fan ribs to the paper drawn various pictures. Use rice-paste, when applying paste, apply to the wooden pillow at first and then apply to the paper by tapping after smearing paste evenly.\r\nAfter drying paste cut the remaining on fan, cut the length of edge of ribs with the same size of paper and trim well with knife.\r\n\r\n6. Last work \r\n\r\nFinish by tying up the narrow part of fan." .
