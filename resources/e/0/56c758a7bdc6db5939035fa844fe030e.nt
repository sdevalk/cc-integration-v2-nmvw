<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/5f479cdf3a9b623cb2ce3d0d417ddab5> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "STORY\r\nThis Dreaming tells the Dreamtime story of the initiation of young girls. During this special time, the older women of the Nungarrayi and Napaljarri skingroup pass sacred information to the young women of the tribe. The women come together from different campsites to share ideas about what is best for them and the community, and to teach the younger girls the sacred tribal stories and knowledge. This ceremony represents the girls transition from childhood to womanhood. After the discussions are over, the women go hunting in the bush. Small digging sticks are used to dig up tucker, which is collected and carried in coolamon dishes (wooden bowls) to feed the large families. The small circles represent the camps where ceremonies are held. The straight lines running from the circles are traveling lines. The two large curved shapes represent the older women (\"police women\"). These police women watch over over to make sure the young girls are listening as the elders pass on information.\r\n\r\nLAJAMANU\r\nLajamanu, an Aboriginal community, lies about four hundred kilometres north of Yuendumu and some five hundred kilometres north of Alice Springs. It is a very isolated place in the desert. Both Yuendumu and Lajamanu are populated by Walpiri, the Aboriginals people who live in this area.\r\n\r\nIn 1948 the Yuendumu settlement was overpopulated. The government decided to forcible relocate a group of 25 Warlpiri to Lajamanu to establish a settlement there. In 1951 another group of 25 Warlpiri from Yuendumu were taken against their will by truck to Lajamanu. Many people walked back to Yuendumu , but were subsequently deported by truck back to Lajamanu. This occured several times.\r\n\r\nSince then children have been born in Lajamanu, meaning that their Dreaming (place) is connected there. The area today has a strong sense of cultural identity probably for reasons of its remoteness. The school is bilingual English and Warlpiri. The area has an effective Aboriginal Town Council. Many of the inhabitants of Lajamanu prefer to live in small family groups on outstations, moving regularly between these outstations and the town.\r\n\r\nThe Warlpiri artists of Lajamanu do not use naturalistic motifs, nor do they use depictions of spears, boomerangs, trees or human footprints. The backgrounds of then paintings consist of dots in one colour to emphasis and heighten the strong lines and forms. These lines and forms often represent the paths walked by the mythological ancestors. As nomadic people in the old days, the Warlpiri used to travel these ancestral paths.\r\n\r\nAmong the major Dreamings painted by men are water, rain, clouds and thunder. The backgrounds of these paintings are often done in white dots. Strong wavy lines represent the rainbows, lightning and thunder.\r\n\r\nThe women's free and lively designs have the immediacy of body paintings and sand drawings. There is no need for symmetry or filling in of space. Each Warlpiri woman has a strong understanding of the Dreamings. They manage their own affairs and secret ceremonies. Women's rituals enshrine their role as nurturers; of people, land and relationships. They often paint to instruct their children in the Dreaming." .
