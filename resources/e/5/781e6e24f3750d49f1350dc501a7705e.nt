It is carved from wood and largely decorated with coix seeds and abrus pips. The eyes of the fish are indicated by abrus pips. There are a few real feathers attached to the body, mainly on the sides and fins. On the bottom there is a hole to which a bamboo stick was attached by means of which the ornament was carried above the bearer's head. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \r\nAccording to the donor, children carried this object attached to a stick during the parade in honour of the marriage of Princess Juliana of the Netherlands. \t\t\t\t\t\t          \t\t\t\t  \r\nThis fish figure is a clan emblem representing a totemic ancestor/animal, whose ritual significance and cultural symbolism are rooted in Marind mythology.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \r\nIVANA HLADKA, 28.11. 2006" .
