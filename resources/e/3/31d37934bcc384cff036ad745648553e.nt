The paper has small charcoal particles, protruding fibres, fragments of blue thread or yarn and micro-holes that were part of the pulp composition and of the papermaking process. They indicate that the paper was made from recycled materials. In northwest India, it was customary to add a dust-cover to precious paintings to protect them from dust, light and other factors of deterioration. \r\nSix lines of Gumurkhi written in black ink. See translation in the Documentation tab." .
