<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/d37277283ba83f2ae387390a6e15663b> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This painting tells the story of the people of the Nakamarra, Jakamarra, Napurrula and Japurrurla skingroups. These people lived around a big bush yam tree(Yarla) at Yumurrpa. People from the neighbouring Waputarli and Nurrypartu tribes were jealous of the Yumurrpa and their yam tree.\r\nThe three tribes had a fight over the yam tree, they used fighting weapons, spears and boomerangs. The Yumurrpa people won the fight and the yam tree. \r\nThe three central concentric circles in the image represent the three different campsites of the tribes. The L shapes represent the people and the straight lines their fighting tools. The circular designs at the outer edge of the painting depict the yam and the curvy lines the roots of the plant.\r\nThis dreaming took place at Waputarli in the Northern territory, Australia" .
