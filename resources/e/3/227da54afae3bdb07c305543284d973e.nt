<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/TM-60049079> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This photograph shows a daytime performance of a barong ket accompanied by three jauk dancers. The performance is being held in a wide open space, whose whereabouts are not known. An eager crowd is present to enjoy the dance, the children in front within touching distance of the barong. In origin, jauk and their female equivalents called telek are thought to be characters in a folk play involving the barong, of the kind seen by the early visitor Julius Jacobs in 1881.  This photograph may depict such a dance. \r\nThe photograph is in an album donated by Augusta de Wit (1864-1939) who visited Bali from October to late December 1911. The photograph was probably made either by De Wit herself or by Carl Gr√ºndler, and probably dates from 1910 or 1911.  \r\nFrancine Brinkgreve" .
