Priests or diviners affiliated with different deities may bless Oroka for different purposes, such as protection of the wearer.\r\n\r\nOnly a small number of Oroka are still known today in institutional collections. Even fewer of those are elaborate forms cast in brass and with coral inlays that would have been worn by the á»Œba (Plankensteiner 2007. p.348). There are a number of simpler forms, without coral, that may have been worn by women of the royal court.\r\n\r\nVingerring bezet met grote rode koraal-'steen'." .
