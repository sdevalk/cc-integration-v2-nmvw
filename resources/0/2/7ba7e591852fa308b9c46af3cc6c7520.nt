<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-2012-9> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "2012-8, 9\r\nTwo pairs of Wendat (Huron) embroidered moccasins; cowhide, cloth, moosehair, pigment; l. 23 cm. (both); ca. 1880.\r\n\tDuring the nineteenth-century, women at the Wendat community of Lorette made moccasins in the puckered toe style common among northeastern peoples such as the Abenakis, Penobscot and Malecites.  Wendat women were known for the richly coloured moosehair embroidery with which they embellished their moccasins (Speck 1911a:211-214; Hatt 1916:168-169).\r\n\tThe two pairs in the Ten Kate collection are examples of the mass moccasin production developed for the tourist market by Wendat entrepreneurs toward the end of the nineteenth century. By this period, the loss of hunting lands and native tanned hides had caused the Wendat and Hodenosaunee to use commercially processed hide, although they turned the untanned surface to the outside in order to more closely imitate the appearance of Native-tanned hide. The hide of the moccasins numbered 2012-9 is dyed. The moosehair embroidered floral designs embroidered on the vamps and cuffs of Ten Kate's moccasins are much simplified from those used at Lorette fifty years earlier. The U-shaped embroidered curve of simple and zigzag blue and white lines remains characteristic of Huron work. (Speck 1911a:9-10). This tourist-style Indian footwear was sold for practical purposes, to be used as slippers, and also as a collectable souvenir (Conn 1979:54,61; Phillips 1990:31-32; 1998:250-254; cf. Thompson 1977:139,142). \r\n\tThe question of whether floral imagery was used by Aboriginal people before the arrival of Europeans has been the subject of much debate among anthropologists, but most scholars have concluded that naturalistic floral representation was introduced by Europeans (Speck 1911a and 1925, Barbeau 1943, Conn 1979a, Brasser 1987, Penney 1991, Phillips 1998).  The stylized floral motifs on Wendat moccasins from the early historic period are derived from skin painting traditions of the eastern Subarctic, while the floral imagery displayed by moosehair embroidery made from the 1830s on is more naturalistic (Phillips 1990:30). When Speck conducted research on the topic at Lorette in 1911, an even more literal realism had developed, and embroiderers identified their designs as representing particular local species. He also noted that, \"as to the flower designs, about the origin of which at present very little in general is known, it seems that with the Huron at least three are native,\" (i.e. of pre-European origin): balsam fir, cat's paw, and star (Speck 1911:8-9,13). Specimen 2012-8 exhibits cat's paw designs, executed in red, pink and white on the vamp and cuff. White flox is depicted on the vamp of 2012-9.\r\n362-5, 2012-8, 9 Wendat (Huron) moosehair embroidered ware\r\nNorthern Woodlands and Subarctic peoples have used the long hairs that grow under the neck of the moose to decorate clothing, accessories and other items since before European contact (Turner 1976). During the early eighteenth century, Ursuline and other French nuns at Quebec, who had learned how to use moosehair from Aboriginal women, invented new kinds of fancy wares of birchbark (Betula Papyrifera) embroidered in dyed moosehair to give as gifts to their patrons in France and North America (Barbeau 1943). They ornamented boxes, fans, pincushions and other items with floral motifs and idealized scenes of the forest life of the 'noble savage.' After the British conquest of Canada, these wares became extremely popular curiosities with the many officials and army officers who were stationed in Canada through the periods of the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 (Phillips 1998:103-109; cf. Thompson 1977:134-139,143; Coe 2003:134-137; Cook 2005:230-233). \r\nBy the 1830s, Wendat (Huron) women had largely taken over the production of fancy bark works, and they further developed the iconographic and stylistic traditions the nuns had established during the eighteenth century. Wendat women also used moosehair embroidery to ornament hide moccasins, cloth seat covers for chairs, tablecloths, and other items that appealed to the tastes of Victorian buyers. They actively marketed their work not only at their village of Lorette (Morissonneau 1978) but also at popular tourist spots and in cities throughout the northeast. In 1861, for example, when the German traveler Johann Kohl visited the Wendat village of Lorette, outside of Quebec City, he saw \"great tons and chests full of moccasins embroidered with flowers, cigar-cases, purses, &c., all made by the women in the village, and which were, I believe, destined to be sent to Montreal, and thence probably to Niagara and New York (1861/I:180).\" \r\nDuring the 1880s, when Ten Kate visited Niagara Falls, the quality of moosehair embroidery had begun to decline due to changes in consumer taste, shifts in the tourist market, and the advent of new forms of mass production at Lorette. By the end of the century, well organized cottage industries for the production of moccasins, snowshoes and canoes had been developed. In 1898, for example, 140.000 pairs of moccasins were made there, the bulk destined for dealers in the Great Lakes region and major cities and resorts in the eastern Canadian provinces and northeastern American states where the moccasins were sold to consumers who often used them as slippers. During his fieldwork in 1908-1909 Frank Speck was unable to identify the natural dyes with which the Huron had originally used to color the moosehair, as they had been using commercial aniline dyes for such a long time (GÃ©rin 1901:553; Speck 1911, 1911a; Brasser 1976:43,158-159; 1998:49; Canada House 1985:14-15,20-22;  Phillips 1990:29-31; 1998:125-126,142,162).\r\n(Phillips 2008-2009)\r\n_____\r\n\r\nLeren mocassins, bestikt met katoenen band, geborduurd met bleom- en plantmotieven in geverfd elandshaar, een typisch product voor de toeristenmarkt." .
