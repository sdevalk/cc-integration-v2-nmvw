It has deep historical roots. Well over a thousand years ago, glass beads, which were especially coveted, were imported via Swahili traders on the coast of East Africa and then spread into the interior of the region via inland trading hubs such as Great Zimbabwe. These beads circulated in even the remotest corners of the region. Archaeological evidence indicates that these beads were manufactured as far away as India, Persia, and the Middle East. European beads were introduced by Portuguese and Dutch traders by the 16th century, and by the 19th century cheaper European beads manufactured in places like Venice were imported in large quantities making it possible to create far larger and more elaborate beadwork objects.\r\n\r\nThese beads were used in the creation of a wide variety of beaded objects such as clothing, jewelry, ceremonial and ritual objects, or decorative objects and tourist art. Many of these practices continue today. The colours and designs of beadwork objects vary from group to group and are subject to change over time. \r\n\r\nBeaded objects were often used to communicate certain messages relating to the status or relationships of the wearer. For colonial Europeans, beads and the messages they carried were seen as evidence of African backwardness and illiteracy. As a result beads were often very prominently featured in stereotypical European images of Southern Africa. At the same time many Africans during the colonial period continued to wear their beadwork with pride as an act of resistance against European notions of what constitutes acceptable clothing and ornamentation. \r\n\r\nOne such ornament is the beaded ‘love letter’ commonly used by many Nguni-language speaking peoples such as the Swazi, Xhosa, and Zulu in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Love letters were beaded objects used during courtship. Among some cultures, such as the Zulu in the late 19th century, topics such as romance was taboo and not discussed openly except through elaborate rituals and negotiations. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the 19th century, the rapid industrialization of Southern Africa led to many men becoming migrant labourers who would travel hundreds or thousands of kilometres to work in the factories or mines of rapidly growing cities such as Johannesburg, often for months at a time. This change in traditional life also led to a change in courtship. Women were often the initiators of courtship and gifted beaded love letters were a way of expressing interest in a potential partner or to communicate private messages.\r\n\r\nEuropean collectors and museums have long been fascinated by these objects and as a result the collections of the Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen and the Wereldmuseum Rotterdam contain many beaded objects described as love letters. Books and museum catalogues frequently associate different colours and designs of love letters with specific meanings, but this interpretation is problematic. Then colour and design of love letters were influenced by cultural preferences and often referenced well known proverbs. However, the messages contained in the beads were often personal and can only be understood by the maker and the intended recipient. \r\n\r\nAs men were often away from home for months at a time, beaded love letters were used not only in courtship but also as a means of communicating messages of love and longing between loved ones separated by the migrant labour economic system. Over time their use declined as other forms of communication such as letter writing or telegrams became more widespread. Today, they are still made, though usually as a form of tourist art. It is very likely that many of the objects in museum collections were made for sale to the tourist market." .
