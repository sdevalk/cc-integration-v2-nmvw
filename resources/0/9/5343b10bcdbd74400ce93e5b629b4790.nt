<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/0311e015ad67f8bc2844c40faf5d593c> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Yuki Kihara's video work Siva in Motion was made to memorialise a devastating tsunami that killed more than 189 people in Samoa,\r\nAmerican Samoa and Tonga in 2009. Siva is the Samoan word for dance and the specific siva performed by Kihara is a unique rendition of a traditional dance called the taualuga. Typically performed by a high-ranking female and/or male as the final dance alter an important village ceremony or least, the taualuga is often accompanied by other dancers whose broader movements and vocal calls counterpoint the contained rhythms and gestures of the taualuga. In her rendition, created as a digital work for exhibition in public art galleries, Kihara performs the dance\r\nalone. Like the work of many Pacific artists for the global contemporary art world today, Siva in Motion is a translation between two worlds. On the one hand, its significance is deeply embedded in the place, culture and history that inspired its creation. lt tells the story of\r\nthe tsunami, etched in the memory of those who lived through it and who shared their experiences wilh the artist. lts length replicates the duration of the destruction. lt uses a 'high' form of dance to honour, remember and pay respect to the dead and injured as it attempts, like the traditional dance, to reaffirm the social bond of Samoan community, despite such disasters. lt Is a dance of personal significance to Kihara as a Samoan person, still connected to the country and the culture. On the other hand, the work is also created as part of her practice as a\r\ncontemporary artist. The siva is performed in the appropriated persona of an anonymous nineteenth-century Samoan woman, photographed in a Victorian mourner's dress by colonial photographer Thomas Andrew. The photograph was discovered by Kihara as a postcard in the archives of the Museum of New Zealand. Giving her the biblical name Salome - recalling either the devoted follower of Christ or the avenging daughter of Herod who danced in exchange for the head of John the Baptist - the figure is sometimes used as Kihara's artistic alter-ego, bridging the present and the colonial past. The work also pays homage to its photographic antecedents, referencing the chronophotographic\r\nexperiments of Eadweard Muybridge and Étienne•Jules Marey. But while their work aimed to stop time and spread out its frozen parts like a deck of cards, Kihara recovers a haunting beauty in the illusion of motion composed of the fading traces of the dancer's movements.\r\n\r\n(Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts p. 310)" .
