<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/0b6c92dee4ebdfd04c82556d7451242e> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This ornament is carved from one piece of wood and was attached to the prow or rear of a canoe. It is shaped like a longish, curved triangle. The bottom part is a solid wooden piece which has carvings all over. Above that there is openwork with loops in different compartments. The rim is toothed. One can easily make out the part of  the ornament which was attached to the dugout canoe, as it is thinner and not decorated. The prow is coloured red with white and black colour on the carvings.  \r\nThe patterns and paintings on the canoe prow were unique to the clans which manufactured them. This way the canoes were easily identified as to their owners and origin. Clan members identified with the symbols on the canoes and it thus built a strong link between the individual members of the clan.  A large canoe was one of the most valuable possessions a clan had regarding the importance of seafaring for  food supply, transport, trade and cultural exchange.\r\nCanoes are also associated with the ancestors which came from the horizon in the \"first canoe\" to settle the islands." .
