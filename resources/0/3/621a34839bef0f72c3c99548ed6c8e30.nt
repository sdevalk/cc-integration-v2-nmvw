Drawing from Abel Tasman's 1642 expedition journal and on the cave art signatures of my Tasmanian forebears, this work responds to both the spirit of exploration and discovery, and to the enduring sense of connection one has with one's country and place of origin. Like the contours of the explorers' maps, the tracings and imprints of clasped hands reveal the passage of time, metaphorically uniting peoples of different cultures through the myriad of life's experience, each existing within a particular geographic location and each with a story to tell." .
