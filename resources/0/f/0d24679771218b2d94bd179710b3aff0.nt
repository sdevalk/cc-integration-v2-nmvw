Gnalluma-tribe.\r\n\r\nWooden fighting spear-heads (magundoo, Taf. II. Fig. 2-4, 8-11 & Taf. III. Fig. 8-9, 16 & 19) are made in various patterns, and have numerous barbs in one, two or more rows, whilst hunting spear-heads (curbing, Taf. II. Fig. 1a III, Fig. 7) have only one barb.\r\n\r\nThe wooden spear-heads are notched at the end and interlocked with a similar notch at the top of the shaft, strongly tied with Kangaroo-sinews and cemented over with bulga.\r\n\r\nThe shafts for hunting-spears are from 10 to 15 feet long, and are straightened by rubbing the crooket part with fat and holding it over red hot coals and bend." .
