<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/21759ef3b6338fa406006a03637e8d45> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Een netsuke uit hout gesneden, met sporen van polychroom lakwerk, voorstellend Daruma, the founder of the Buddhist Zen-sect, seated in meditation, his hands folded.\r\n\r\nThis netsuke represents Daruma in a characteristic pose, quite often found in netsuke. Daruma can be identified, apart from the pose, by an earring in one of his ears, an unshaved chin and part of his clothing over his head. Daruma - who spent nine years in meditation - also is credited with the invention of tea, which he drank to stay awake and according to one legend, growing first from his eyelids which he cut off to accomplish that. Also, he is said to have lost his legs in the nine years of meditation and thus became popularized as a kind of tumbling doll, also now still used in ceremonies to start major projects whereby one eye ls painted at the start, the other at the completion (Cf. for example RMV ...- and ---).\r\n\r\nSmall netsuke in lacquer, like this one, were especially suited for use in connection with lacquered inro and, in view of the costly technique, can be regarded as having been used by members of the samurai class or rich merchants. Also the subject would well suit the warrior-class which generally adhered to the Zen direction in Buddhism.\r\n\r\nThis netsuke is made in lacquer and more specifically in the so-called technique of negoro lacquerwork, consisting of a red lacquered base covered in black lacquer and then partially polished so that a nice effect of these colours is obtained.  \r\nCf. 1555-23 for a similar netsuke in an imitation of this technique,  executed in celluloid - or possibly some other artificial material - and cast from a mold." .
