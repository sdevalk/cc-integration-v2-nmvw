Ancestral beings left behind them a reservoir of spiritual power during their epic journeys during the Ancestral Past. Certain places, that are associated with major creative acts, are more concentrated with power. These places have a more concentrated amount of conception spirits, which hel are thought to be effective in the conception of children. Conception sites are often surrounded by mermaid mythology in Arnhem Land. There are different versions of the myth, but the mermaid is always a young woman, with a fishtail and associated with water. The sites where mermaids reside are powerful fertility sites. The Mermaid's journey during the Ancestral Past, is an unifying metaphor between different groups in the Arnhem Land region." .
