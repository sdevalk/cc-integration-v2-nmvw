The four red circles at the top and centre contain the names of Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthman and ‘Ali, and along the lower edge, those of three of the Companions of the Prophet, Talhah bin ‘Ubaid Allah, Sa‘d bin Abi Waqqas and ‘Abd al-Rahman bin ‘Awf. The second green panel at the top has the hadith, ‘Between my tomb and my minbar lies one of the gardens of Paradise and my minbar is on my pool.’" .
