Sometimes compared to the European notion of mermaids, they exist as spiritual beings living in freshwater streams, particularly those in the stone country. The spirit Yawkyawk are usually described and depicted with the tails of fish. Thus the Kuninjku people sometimes call them ngalberddjenj which literally means 'the woman who has a tail like a fish'. They have long hair which is associated with trailing blooms of green algae, called man-bak in Kuninjku, found in freshwater streams and rock pools. At times they leave their aquatic homes to walk about on dry land, particularly at night.                                              Aboriginal people believe that at one time all animals were humans. During the time of the creation of landscapes and plants and animals, these animal ancestor heroes in human form changed into their animal forms via a series of various significant events now recorded as oral mythologies. The creation ancestor yawkyawk which in the Kuninjku language also means ýoung woman' travelled the country in human form and changed into the form of ngalkunburriyaymi as a result of various ancestral adventures. Today the Kuninjku believe that ngalkunburriyaymi are alive and well and living in freshwater sites in a number of sacred locations.                                                                                                                                          The Kuninjku also believe that '\"clever'\" men (magicians with mystical powers called in Kuninjku na-kordang) may take these spirits as wives. The father of Mandarrk, a well known artist who resided in the Central Arnhem area, is daid to have had such a spirit as a wife. Unfortunately, it is said, she failed one day to return from being sent to fetch water from the river, and returned to her kin. The ngalkunburiyaymi also have husbands and children of their own kind. Their sites are usually shared  with the rainbow serpent ngalyod. Some have ritual importance, for example in some paintings, the yawkyawk spirit holds ceremonial string, just like the lengths of string women hold between both hands today during certain public ceremonies.                                                                                                                                     There are at least three major ngalkunburriyaymi sacred sites that are well known in the area south and south-west of Maningrida. One site is on the Mann River at a place near Yikarrakkal Outstation where the Mann River has  rugged rocky banks and clefts beneath stone overhangs in the water. Another very similar site further west in the Kumadderr River district is surrounded by a number of small but very old rock art sites and has become known in English as '\"Dreaming Lady\"\". A third site is a major yawkyawk dreaming place which is so significant that the traditional clan custodians have set up an outstation community called Barrihdjowkkeng, near the site and the identity of this group is very much related to their yawkyawk dreaming for which they have spiritual and practical responsibility. This group, known as the Dangkorlo clan, are well known for their bark paintings and sculptures of yawkyawk." .
