<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/2c7615cff71df91a293ed65396a0ea80> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "A bokor is a round bowl with a low flaring rim, usually of silver, but in palaces golden ones were not uncommon. They are still widely used in Bali, now mostly made of much cheaper aluminium. They are commonly used as a base for large offerings, banten gebogan, tall, tower-shaped arrangements of fruits and cakes, carried to the temple and presented to gods and deified ancestors. A bokor is also used as a container for smaller offerings and gifts brought to a house where a ritual is being held. Sometimes a bokor functions as a tray for the various boxes and containers of a betel or sirih set. \r\nThe upright rim of this beautiful golden bokor is decorated with three bands of repouss√© ornamentation. These motifs are divided, as usual, into karang (rock or reef) motifs and decorative floral patterns, patra. On this bokor, the narrow top band is filled with small spiral patterns, like a snail (kakul-kakulan). On the broad central band four groups of demonic kala faces alternate with groups of plain oval-shaped motifs. Each group of kala faces consists of a karang kala (demon motif) or karang tapel (mask motif) in the centre, flanked by two outward-looking raven or crow motifs (karang goak). The bottom rim is filled by the flower motif called patra sari.  \r\nThis golden offering bowl was looted by Dutch troops from the palace of Klungkung, after the so-called Puputan Klungkung on 28 April 1908." .
