Yet it looks like an outrigger voyaging canoe :  a vaka.\r\nGenerally the crew used to be represented by little tiki figurines in the canoe model. Canoe models were used before the encounter with European people. Numerous accounts referred to canoe models having prophylactic functions found in funeral or sacred places. The canoe prow is the largest end while the other is the stern, so the tiki seem to be in a wrong position, looking towards the back." .
