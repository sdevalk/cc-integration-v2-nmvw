To make it sound, the body of the bullroarer is swung on the string in a rapid circular motion. This produces a deep, whirring sound, changing in tune while the string shortens. \r\nIn Abelam a bullroarer is played during the male initiations and is particularly associated with the second of their eight successive stages. Though used exclusively by men this instrument has a feminine name and associations.\r\n\r\nIts main function, that it shares with other instruments, used in initiations, is to warn women and uninitiated men away from the initiation activities. Abelam men describe these sacred instruments as “the voices of the Nngwal” and the children of spiritual beings created in the ceremonies. \r\nOrigins myth:\r\nThe myth of their origin accounts a story of some young men who fell asleep near pools of water inhabited by Wale – the water spirits.  They dreamed about the sound and the shape of these instruments and on awakening knew how to make them.  Water in Abelam and Arapesh cultures bears associations with femininity, procreation, birth and death, and the myth of the origins of musical instruments exemplifies the transmutation of these symbols  from the female to the male domain." .
