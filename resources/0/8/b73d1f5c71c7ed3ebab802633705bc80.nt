<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7271-1> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "A key chain from Bogor or Tangerang, cities close to Jakarta, where it was called a sangketan poohwa according Jasper en Pringadie (de Inlandsche Kunstnijverheid). It is probably made by Peranakan Chinese craftsmen in West-Java. \r\nThe decoration of this key-chain is as follows: \r\nFive little keys, all decorated with two snakes; A bigger key, that may have been used properly; three amber boxes, round, in the shape of a fruit; One box, may be for amber, in the shape of a crab. \r\nThe actual hook is missing and the round key chain ring may not be the original one.\r\nJasper and Pirngadie describe the Javanese custom of wearing a decoration at the end of a handkerchief, as a symbol of wealth and good taste.  Most important is the container for amber, the so called cepuk ambar or cupon ambar. This was also used by Indies ladies. The Bogor or Tangerang key chains were generally worn by Chinese women." .
