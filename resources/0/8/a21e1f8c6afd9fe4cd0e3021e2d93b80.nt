<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-2802-163> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This bag is plaited of bast fibre. The fibre can be taken from different trees. Some fibres are dyed dark to create a contrasting pattern. The bag has a rectangular shape.\r\nThe bag is manufactured by women and the plaiting is intrinsically associated with women. First, the bottom is plaited into the desired width. Then the two sides are plaited upwards in one piece. The fibres at the sides are plaited into several cords or left loose. When the bag is used, the cords or loose fibres are knotted together to form a carrying strap. In the centre of the opening, some fibres are left to close the bag. The bottom has a fringe of fibres. Additional decoration is sewn to the bag in the form of strips of red cotton, which are fixed with a glass bead.\r\nThe pattern is created through the different colours of the fibres and the alteration of the binding structure. The patterns consist of geometrical patterns like rhomboids, triangles and rectangles.\r\nThe bag is used mostly by women. Women carry those bags on their back, with the straps knotted and placed on top of the head. They are used for carrying plants, roots and fruit from the gardens and market. Even children can be carried in them.\r\nBags are also used for ceremonial purposes, for example are they used to wrap a dead person. Brides can be adorned with empty bags. The elaborate patterns and decorations are used to show off a woman's skill in handcraft which is important to attract a man as a future housewife." .
