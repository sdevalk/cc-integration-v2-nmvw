<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-2802-80> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This adze is carved of dark brown wood and polished smooth. It has the form of a knee, the typical form of adzes in the region. \r\nThe handle is a carved-out animal mouth, most likely a stylized crocodile's mouth. At the bend there is an increase in a circular form.  \r\nThe axe is primarily used for wood processing and therefore used primarily by men. This exemplar is probably missing its blade, which was made from obsidian or from shell.\r\nAn axe can also have a ceremonial function, when it belongs to a certain kin group, where one official holds it and passes it to his successor. The adze is kept in the roof of the men's house and is placed visibly at the entrance on festive occasions. When goods are exchanged, the official points to the goods with the adze. \r\nThe adze is also a symbol of justice, peace and harmony and is therefore present during reconciliatory meetings." .
