<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/IB2020-5-2> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Numerous smaller islands in western and southwestern Oceania - within the 'culture areas' conventionally referred to as Micronesia and Melanesia - were settled by speakers of Polynesian languages who migrated westwards at various times in the later prehistoric period. These communities are referred to as Polynesian ''outliers'' and include the Tikopia, famously studied by the anthropologist Raymond Firth, as well as the people of Nukumanu, a cluster of atolls that now forms part of the nation of Papua New Guinea, but is situated almost 450 miles northeast of New lreland. near the atoll of Ontong Java, a related outlier culture, which is administered by the Solomon lslands. Like many other Polynesian peoples, those of Nukumanu created sculptures of gods and ancestors. This figure, named Popua and said to be pre-eminent among the community's founding ancestor-gods, was situated within a cult-house at the centre of a shrine incorporating two similar but much smaller figures, said to be his attendants; he wore fine woven mats, and a shell necklace, arranged like a crown on the head. The work\r\nwas acquired by Captain Kart Nauer. who served on commercial vessels within German New Guinea between 1903 and 1913 and\r\ncollected extensively tor the Ãœbersee-Museum in Bremen and a number of other German institutions.\r\n(Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts p. 294)" .
