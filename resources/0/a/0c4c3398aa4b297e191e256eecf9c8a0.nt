The animal's body has been wrapped in a rectangular sheet of fine linen (warp-faced tabby, pale brown), which covers the back and sides. This sheet is now much decayed and has largely been replaced by modern cloth during a recent restoration. The ventral side of the body is covered by strips of pleated linen (width 0.6-1.1 cm): five overlapping strips lengthwise on either side of the central axis, plus the same number of transverse strips above (adjacent to the neckline), with two transverse strips a bit lower on the chest. The outer one of these parallel bands is darker in colour, the foot end is damaged. Around the neck of the animal, there are five windings of a narrow strip of doubled linen. The head is covered by irregular curved bandages at the rear, a single piece of linen over the front of the muzzle, and a 6.5 cm broad strap passed over the top and tucked in at the neck (fine warp-faced tabby, pale brown, 15 x 56 threads/cm2). Two roughly discoid pieces of folded linen have been fixed onto this strap in order to render the eyes (black outlines and pupil; the right eye is original, the left one a modern restoration). Two triangular ears of folded linen have been inserted just behind the strap. Holes in the outer cover of the head show much coarser linen underneath (8 x 14 threads/cm2).
