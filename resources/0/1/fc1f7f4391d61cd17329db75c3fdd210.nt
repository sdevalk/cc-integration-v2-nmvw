Rotanschacht, met ingesneden versiering : bovenaan spiralen, verder alleen smalle en brede ringen.\r\n\r\nThe arrows consist generally of two component parts, the head of the bamboo or palm wood, either hardened in the fire or not, and the shaft, made of cane. Not seldom however a fore shaft is introduced in between, and sometimes a special tip is fastened on to the arrow head. \r\nThere are several kinds of arrows depending on the use. They were used to hunt, to fish and to fight. \r\nBows and arrows could be deposited in the grave of its wearer after his death. At Asei, in the fence around a grave, the bow of the death man is stuck straight into the soil (See Sande, 1907, p. 271, fig. 166)\r\nSande noticed that arms were always carried when going outside the village, and the women working in the gardens were accompanied by men in case of an attack." .
