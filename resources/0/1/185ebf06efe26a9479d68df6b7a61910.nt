It seems like paper for making fans, but only wrapping paper is distinctively made from so called an old Korean technique of making paper. \r\n\r\nThe below is how to make the coloured paper from Sunchang, Jollabukdo province, Korea. \r\nFirstly roll the mulberry paper on bamboo, secondly dissolve the dye in boiling water and thirdly cool the water to lukewarm, lastly put the paper in and, holding one end and unwind it with a twirl. \r\nPutting lime and alum in the water prevented the dye from weakening and kept the colour fresh. After the dyeing process, drying and smoothing were done the same way as for ordinary Korean mulberry paper. Only for making light blue paper dipped without boiling and cooling.  Old coloured paper is mostly thick mulberry paper.  Due to manufacture on a small scale, only small quantities were made in the past that coloured paper was considered valuable, an article to be used for presentation to royalty. The difficulty of mass production is the main obstacle to the revival of coloured paper manufacture today." .
