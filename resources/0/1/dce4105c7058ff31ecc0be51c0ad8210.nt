Op het groen veld, waarop een aantal bloeiende struiken staan, zijn vier personages in aanbiedende houding afgebeeld. Drie hiervan dragen de gebruikelijke kleding van de Sikhs." .

<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-3025-46> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#material> "schildering op papier\r\nVasli or thick painting support made from a lamination of Indian handmade paper sheets, opaque watercolour, gold and silver paints. \r\nBecause of their bold colours and texture, some of the paints could be synthetic.\r\nThe scene is surrounded by a narrow band painted in black with small coloured dots, and wider borders originally painted in white. There is also a couple of purple ruled lines, one drawn with a ruler and the other painted.\r\nNext to the three men and the child, probably the devotees and patrons of the painting, are handwritten their names that are difficult to decipher. \r\nThe reverse is blank but has numerous marks and stains attesting to the cult of painting. \r\nThis painting was probably the object of a domestic devotion. The holes within the paint support could indicate that the work was hung on a wall. This is also confirmed by the various stains, tide lines, support deformation, and splashes of unidentified liquids. The painting as it was displayed on a wall, has been subjected to the vicissitudes of family life. The format of the painting and the use of a rich and diverse palette may suggest that the patrons had some financial means." .
