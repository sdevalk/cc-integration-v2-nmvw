Paint used to make the eye. \r\nWhen the different European colonists such as the British, French and Spanish were driven out the United States in the 19th century, the Indians faced a united white power. The government's policy aimed at conquering Indian land. Although many tribes were by this time weakened by new diseases, high rates of alcoholism and land loss, some Indian peoples managed to adapt to white culture. These acculturated Indians, often led by people of mixed descent tried to prove the whites that they were not savages but as civilized as they were by adopting white culture. By the 1820's the Cherokees, Chickasaws, Choctaws and Creeks were known as the Civilized Tribes. Especially the Cherokees were made progress in acculturation. Besides adopting Christianity they founded schools, an English-Cherokee newspaper and an elected government modelled after the United States Constitution. However, more and more Indian tribes were forced to leave their homelands and move to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). Some of these removals were badly executed and many people died on their journey to Indian Territory of hunger, cold and disease. The removal of the Cherokees, which cost 4,000 people their lives, is one of the most notorious of these removals and known as the Trail of Tears. The last removal to Indian Territory occurred when the Seminoles were finally defeated in 1842 after a war of seven years. The Seminoles became the fifth Civilized Tribe." .
