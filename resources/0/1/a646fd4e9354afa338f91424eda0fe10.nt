It was seized from the palace of Klungkung after the so-called Puputan Klungkung on 28 April 1908. It was most likely made by gold- and silversmiths, pande mas, who lived in Kamasan and worked to order for the Klungkung courts.\r\nThe custom of betel chewing, which carries an important role in various social activities and ceremonies, was widespread in Bali. For enjoyment as a stimulant, ingredients for the betel quid were offered to guests as a sign of welcome and token of politeness. Although there has been a marked decrease in the daily use of this in Bali, the offering of sirih is still regarded as a sign of hospitality, and as confirmation of relationships. In a ritual context, betel ingredients are at present mainly used as part of offerings to deities and ancestors.\r\nBasic ingredients for betel chewing are betel (sirih) leaf (Piper bitle), areca (pinang palm) nut (Areca catechu) and lime (Calcium exyde). Gambir (Unracia/Uncaria gambir) and tobacco are both potential additions to the basic elements of the betel quid, in order to render the whole more fragrant.\r\nAnyone who chewed betel or sirih had the basic ingredients to hand in a simple compartmented open box made of wood, or a bag made of bamboo or, among people of higher social status, in all kinds of little containers, boxes, and bowls, placed together on a beautiful dish or tray. Especially in the context of a royal palace or princely court, boxes or containers for the ingredients of the betel quid were usually beautifully decorated and made of precious materials, like gold or silver, decorated with gemstones.  In the same way that the accumulated powers of the ancestors are believed to reside in a heirloom keris, a betel set was also often part of the most valuable inherited items, the pusaka, because of its connection with the presence of the ancestors.   Betel sets were even incorporated into the state regalia. \r\nIn their portraits, rulers often had themselves shown with a fine sirih set close at hand. A complete sirih set or only some of the containers were also a favoured item for presents or diplomatic gifts from one ruler or senior official to another. \r\n\tThis box from the Klungkung palace was beaten out of sheets of gold. The various parts were hammered into shape and decorated, before soldering.  The process of embossing decorations from the back is called repoussé work. Final details to the design are done by chasing on the front side. \r\nLike most Balinese gold and silverwork the box is richly decorated with geometric, foliate and floral borders, influenced by Indian motifs and by Hindu-Javanese temple ornamentation. The general name of these flower motifs is patra.  \r\nThe gold container for tobacco is called lopa-lopa or tépak.  The sides of the box are decorated with rows of triangles and meandering tendril and flower motifs, patra sari, also called “recalcitrant spiral”, a motif which often occurs as Hindu-Javanese temple wall ornament.  Also the lid is decorated with flower borders and a rim of meanders, or banji motifs, associated with ancient solar symbols." .
