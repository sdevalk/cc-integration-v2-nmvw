Production of agave for food and textiles began in Preclassic times, and the desert plant became an incipient cultivar, much emphasized during the Hohokam Classic period when the heart of the plant was roasted and the fibers were used for sandals, cordage, etc. As an anomaly, Bernard-Shaw (1983:395-396,442-443) noted the lack of association of tabular knives and agave roasting pits in the Salt-Gila area. Tabular knives were probably manufactured by specialist craftsmen (Neitzel 1991:186-187)\r\n(Wilcox and Hovens 2008-09)" .
