The fringe is decorated with snail shells, seeds and red cotton. \r\nThese decorated aprons are worn for festivities by women. Either two or four cloths are tied around the hip and fixed with a broad plaited belt. A small part is folded over the belt and fixed with another, smaller belt. Two cloths go on the front and the back and if four cloths are worn, they are worn on the sides, so that it looks like a skirt. The decoration is always in the front." .
