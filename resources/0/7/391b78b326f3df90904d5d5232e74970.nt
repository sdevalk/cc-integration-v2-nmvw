The overflowing pot with Pongal (either a sweet or savoury rice dish that is prepared on the day of the festival) is a symbol of a prosperous pongal. Inside the pot, there is a picture of a man working the fields--indicative of the benefit that will come on harvest day. On the left hand side of the poster, you see a depiction of the popular Tamil film star Rajnikanth." .
