<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-2385-29> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This ceremonial dance ornament represents a parrot. Its beak, small head, round body and tail are carved from wood. Its eyes are also indicated by abrus pips. The top is largely decorated with coix seeds and abrus pips. The eyes of the bird are also indicated by abrus pips. The parts without pips have been painted yellow. There are a few real feathers attached to the body, mainly on the sides and wings. On the bottom there is a hole to which a stick was attached by means of which the ornament was carried above the bearer's head. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \r\nAccording to the donor, children carried this object attached to a stick during the parade in honour of the marriage of Princess Juliana of the Netherlands.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t \r\nThe bird ornament is a replica of a clan emblem representing a totemic ancestor/animal, whose ritual significance and cultural symbolism are rooted in Marind mythology.\r\nA red parrot (voi) \"inspects the dead upon their arrival in the eastern abode of the dead\" (Van Baal, 1966: 284). Parrots are the ornaments of dema Aramemb. He \"is recognized by the two red parrots and the zambu on his head. Round his middle he has a big bow, the two ends protruding on either side of his body. He dances on the beach...\" (ibid.: 532).\r\n\r\nThe biggest of all parrot species found in New Guinea is a black cockatoo (kapiog) belonging to the pig clan (Basik-Basik) of the Bragai-ze phratry. \r\n\r\nDehevai, literally \"shooting father\", referring to the headhunting activity associated with Nazr, the pig dema (Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 51, Fig. 2), enters the mayo-mirav masked as a black cockatoo (kapiog).  He wears \"a peculiar headgear made of sago-leaves and decorated with big, red-rimmed eyeholes and black feathers.\" (Van Baal, 1966: 409). \"In one hand he holds a spear (dam, a javelin; cf. Geurtjens, Dict. voc. cit.), in the other the imbassum. ... a small [black] stone artefact, about 7 cm long, beak-shaped at one end and with a few notches near the other end for the strings by means of which the artefact is fastened to a stick ... to demonstrate its use as a [ceremonial] spear-thrower\" (ibid.: 413).\r\n\r\nThus Dehevai \"'shoots' his flashes, and this activity is symbolized by the black cockatoo performer who 'shoots' his javelin by means of a spear-thrower [imbassum], the instrument which once the thunder dema imprudently presented to a human being. ... The black cockatoo being the representative of the thunder dema in ritual, the name of the dema could also be applied to the animal and thus Dehevai could become a synonym for kapiog (ibid.: 414). \"...he wears a black cockatoo mask and holds a spear and a spear-thrower in his hand. He is the demon of the thunderstorm and of headhunting\" (ibid.: 531).  \"In the ritual Nazr [as Dehevai] is not a killer, but a headhunter and his bird, the kapiog, appears in the headhunting season\" (ibid.: 415). He appears at the conclusion of the ritual just before the start of headhunting raids.\r\n \r\nIVANA HLADKA, 20.11. 2006" .
