<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-5715-2679> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The doll maker starts with the neck and body by folding a husk in a pestlelike form. Other husks are wrapped around the body to give it more shape. After that, husks are rolled or braided into shape and tightly around the ankles. The foot is bent forward and wound into shape. The arms are made in a similar fashion. Strings are wound and tied around the neck and waist. The head is made by peeling and coring a green apple, molding the features to resemble a human face and hung up to dry. Every day, the features are molded further until the apple looks like a small human face. Such apple, attached to a cornhusk body represents a spirit called Loose-Feet, who grants wishes to young children." .
