Table-land.\r\n\r\nBestaande uit twee dunne boomtakjes, de liggende dikker dan de staande, wordt gebruikt bij het vuur maken door middel van wrijving [Bron: E. Clement; Schmeltz 1903; beschrijvingskaart]\r\n\r\nFire is readily made by twirling a dry stick [zie 1207-44] rapidly round in the cavity of another stick. A little groove is cut for the powdered wood to escape. The stick is held between the toes in a horizontal position on the ground and a second is rapidly twirled between the palm of the hands, like the whisk of an European cook, when beating eggs or cream. As soon as the fine saw-dust or woody powder, produced by the rotation of the vertical stick begins to ignite, a little dry grass is placed around and the glowing sparks blown into a flame.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how quickly they can produce fire in this manner. Some variety of wood is better than an other, and should they go on a long hunting expedition or change their camp to a distant part of the district, the women take their \"gillingharra\" or fire sticks, with them." .
