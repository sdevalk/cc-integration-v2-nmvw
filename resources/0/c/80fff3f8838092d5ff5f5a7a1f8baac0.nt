It is rectangular with a high back and longish, triangular side pieces. The front opens up so that is can be used to scoop out water from a boat. The back side has carved in patterns which are coloured white. Three little bird figures sit on the rim. The handle, which is fixed parallel to the long side of the bailer and projects inward, is also angular and very smooth. Its end is adorned with a bird's head. \r\nA bailer was always carried with in the canoes or big outrigger boats to get rid of the water which flooded the boats." .
