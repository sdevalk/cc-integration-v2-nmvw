La Billardière described several fishhook types, including one with a metal barb instead of the more habitual turtle shell or bone tip.  ‘Two bone fishhooks with line’, as described in Buyskes’s list, closely resemble other 18th- and 19th-century examples.  Both have lines made of coconut husk fibre. One (RV-34-14) is a turtle shell hook mounted on pearl shell and lashed with coconut fibre. The other (RV-34-13) is comparable in overall shape to one depicted in La Billardière’s Atlas but differs in the way the turtle shell hook is mounted on its shaft (Figure 5).  The body of the third fishhook (RV-34-12) is made of wood, though Buyskes listed ‘a bone fishhook’.  The lashing is still intact, including the fibres that supposedly held a bone or turtle shell hook. This fishhook type corresponds to the one represented in the Atlas, although the angle of the wood is not as sharp (Figure 5).  It is not clear how long ago the tip of the fishhook disappeared, whether before it was acquired by the Leiden museum or during a move of storage location." .
