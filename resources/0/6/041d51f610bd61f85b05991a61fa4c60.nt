The wide end of the horn is capped with a wooden disk. The tip of the powder horn has been removed and replaced with a brass rifle shell to pour the powder. Originally it had a wooden peg as a stopper, but this is now lost. Images of animals (two turtles, a large fish, a horse, and two unidentified quadrupeds), a hunter with a rifle, and plants are carved into the horn's surface, as is the name of Joe Mant.\r\nThe origin of this type of powder horn has somewhat been contentious as both Indians and white settlers made such artifacts much in the same manner, and the naturalistic carving is not distinctive of any ethnic group. However, many of these specimens are rather personalized because of the carving, and it is not likely that much exchange of such items took place between Indians and whites.\r\nAssuming on original Chickasaw origin, the carvings on the powder horn suggest hunting magic in which animals were ritually lured towards the hunters. In preparation of the hunt, animal spirits were requested their forgiveness. Failure to do so was believed to cause disease by vengeful animal spirits. Part of the prey was given as an offering to the chief of the species (Hudson 1976:340,346,357). Powder horns were originally made from buffalo horn. This animal was frequently encountered in the northwestern part of the Southeast culture, in Chickasaw territory. Possibly buffalo horns were also traded eastwards from the Plains. When the buffalo herds became virtually extinct, horns of cows became the replacement.\r\n(Hovens 2009)\r\n\r\nKruithoorn Oklahoma State kruithoorn; gedeelte van een buffelhoorn; de wijde opening is gesloten met een stuk hout dat aan de hoornwand is vastge- spijkerd.
