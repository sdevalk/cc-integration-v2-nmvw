<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/b0f32cda25c76dee9b1c5647f947fc14> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This is an example of a sewn canoe which was also sometimes called \"flying proa\".  this term was given to the canoes from the Caroline Islands by the Spanish sailors who where the first Europeans to see them and was later used to refer to all voyaging canoes from Micronesia.\r\nThe rigging of the Marshall island is specific which differentiate it from that from Kiribati and Fiji. Firstly it does not have flying buttress to retain the mat in the outrigger side. It avoids capsizing if wind pushes mast on the outrigger side. Secondly the shrouds are numerous (from 3 to 7) to prevent the mast to bend. This canoe measures from 6 to 7 meters long. It was often use when Neyret wrote his book in 1975, because it could easily get into the water. It is fast and light, and could be used to travel between islands if the sea was calm.\r\n\r\nKnowledge of navigational techniques was a closely guarded secret, kept and passed down only within certain chiefly families. Restricted to chiefly men, the art of navigation was vital to the success of any voyage and possession of it brought great prestige and status." .
