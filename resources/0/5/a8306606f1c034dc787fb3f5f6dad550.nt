<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-361-33> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Apache awl case; harness leather, buckskin, thread, German silver; l. (incl. fringe) 25.5 cm., w. 3.5 cm.; ca. 1880.\r\nThis specimen is presumed to be collected in June/July 1883 at either San Carlos or Camp Apache, Arizona, or in Santa Fe in July 1883 from a merchant who obtained it from Mescaleros or Jicarillas who had been at the Tertio-Millennial Exposition. Rather plain at first glance, this awl case is actually rather elaborate in both construction and decoration. The simple sheath with a buckskin suspension loop was sewn with thread, but the bottom was then tightly braided. The bottom has eight flat fringes with a German silver band clipped at the end of each. Finally, now nearly invisible, the body of the case was decorated front and back with parallel lines and chevrons tooled into the leather. \t\r\nWhat Apache group made this awl case is unknown at this time. A San Carlos example with no fringe or engraving is known, as is what is probably a Mescalero example, with no fringe, but with a fitted cap of the same harness leather.\r\n\r\nMany men and women carried an awl of bone, antler, wood or iron in buckskin cases ornamented with fringes, beadwork, painting and sometimes metal tinklers. Men used awls for mending horsegear, and, while away from camp, moccasins and clothing. Women used awls in weaving baskets, and in sewing and decorating buckskin clothing (Ten Kate 2004:197)." .
