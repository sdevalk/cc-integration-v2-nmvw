The net is probably also made of rattan fibre or other plant fibre. A naturally forked branch serves as handle. The whole is therefore shaped like a bend triangle. \r\nThe net is used by women and men, where the nets are used in pairs by one individual. They are used in shallow water or riffs for catching small fish. When a wave washes the fish up, the two nets are brought together and the fish are caught inside." .
