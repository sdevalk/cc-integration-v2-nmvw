<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-09-358> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Hardwood decorated sword-club, as used by men of the Larrakia, Iwaidja and neighbouring groups of region between Darwin and Cobourg Peninsula region, Northern Territory.\r\nDecorated with panels of red and yellow ochred designs, separated by transverse bars of black charcoal or manganese. Object not sighted, so it is unclear whether the surface is engraved with parallel fluting (which is unusual for this object type), whether the handle is wrapped with fibre string (not uncommon), and the degree to which the tip of the handle has a concave indentation (typical in the region). Unclear whether the decoration is applied to both sides, or the degree to which the club is plano-convex or bi-convex." .
