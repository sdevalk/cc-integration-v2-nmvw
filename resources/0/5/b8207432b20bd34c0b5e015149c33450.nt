(doubled over) 28 cm.; ca. 1880.\r\nThis necklace features a variety of seed and trade beads, many of irregular shape. Necklaces were a common fashion accessory. Before silver jewelry and glass beads were introduced, necklaces were fashioned from a variety of seeds and beads. Among the former dried juniper berries dominated. Traditionally, beads were made from bone, turquoise, coral and abalone and clam shell, but the Navajos obtained the beads from marine sources mostly as finished products from their Pueblo neighbors. In colonial times the Spanish imported coral to distribute as gifts. Prehistoric Anasazi sites also yielded beads from marine origins, and these were collected and threaded by Navajos. Some necklaces, probably for ceremonial purposes, were made from the claws of lynxes and mountain lions. Amulets of scented grass were sometimes worn on necklaces. Necklaces of round, ovoid and so-called squash-blossom (actually pomegranate) beads, made from silver, rapidly replaced the glass bead necklaces, and within a short time a wide variety of pendants were developed and added (Orchard 1929:65-67; Woodward 1938:31-33; Kluckhohn et.al. 1971:299-302; Bedinger 1973:34-6,79-85; Tanner 1978; cf. Frank and Holbrook 1990:177; Tisdale 2006:62-65,98-101).\r\n\r\n(Hovens 2009)\r\n\r\n361-15, 26 through 31d, 62a,b Navajo jewelry\r\nNavajos wore jewelry long before the arrival of the Spanish. Necklaces, bracelets and earring were made from strings of turquoise, shell, and coral, valued raw materials that were obtained in intertribal trade. In earlier times bracelets were also made from deer horn. This material became pliable when boiled, and could be bent in the required shape. Turquoise was then applied with pi√±on gum.\r\nWell before 1800 Navajos wore items of iron, copper, brass, and silver jewelry obtained through exchanges with Plains and Mexican Indians, and through trade with Spanish-Americans and Mexicans. Informants stated that copper and brass jewelry had preceded silver jewelry. These materials were referred to in the Navajo language as red, yellow, and white metal respectively, the latter known as beshlah-k'ai. Although historical documentation is lacking, it is quite probably that some Navajo men were involved in smithing during this early time. The first reference to a Navajo silversmith dates from about 1850 and mentions Atsidi Sani (Old Smith) who learned the craft from a Mexican platero (silversmith). In 1853 a Mexican silversmith started working at the Navajo Agency at Washington Pass. Silver belts and horse bridles became cherished items of status among Navajo men, and women prided themselves with brass bracelets. As parts of annual issues, Navajos received copper and brass kettles, as well as copper and brass wire. In addition, they obtained silver coins, American and Mexican. All could be used as raw materials for making jewelry. During their captivity at Fort Sumner from 1864-1868 more Navajos probably learned to make copper, brass, and silver jewelry, and after the return of the people to their homeland the production by tribal craftsmen increased rapidly, with silver soon eclipsing the use of less precious metals.\r\nThe use of turquoise in silverwork since approximately 1880 increased with the passage of time. Navajo artisans at first worked to satisfy tribal demand, and as Indians began to transform their growing wealth in silver items, jewelry became of major importance in interethnic trade as it could be pawned and redeemed. Gradually a trade in silver finery with neighbouring Native peoples developed. From the Navajos, the craft of silversmithing spread to the Zunis (see chapter X), Hopis, and Rio Grande Pueblos. With the completion of the transcontinental railroad through northern New Mexico and Arizona at the time Ten Kate was conducting his fieldwork in 1882-1883, a new market opened up. Travellers and the first tourists began to pick up items of Navajo silver jewelry as souvenirs and as wearable fashion accessories. Production soon increased, and was facilitated by using a variety of stamps to decorate silver items, and white traders such as the Fred Harvey Company who began to play an increasingly important part in supplying the tourist and eastern markets. Guided by their innate craftsmanship and tribal aesthetics, the Navajo incorporated new techniques, tools, shapes, forms, designs, and symbols, resulting in a extensive palette of silver and turquoise jewelry and exquisite utilitarian items that keeps captivating a contemporary audience (Matthews 1883; Franciscan Fathers 1910:271-285; Woodward 1938; Adair 1944:3-28,36,193-4; Mera 1960; Bedinger 1973:1-22,41-50,105-118; Neumann 1977; Jernigan 1981; Witherspoon 1981; Wheat 1982; Lincoln 1982; Roessel 1983:62-65; Frank and Holbrook 1990:3-24; Cirillo:1992:67-82; Kline 2001; Tisdale 2006).\r\n\r\n(Hovens 2009)" .
