<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/af225ed267c96048152ce8da0243629d> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Jemez traditionally purchased most of its pottery from neighbouring Zia. The 1920s witnessed a failed attempt to revive its modest pottery tradition. During the Depression Jemez pottery was limited to imitations of the poster-paint tourist miniatures produced in large quantities at Tesuque (see below). After the war acrylic paints took over. This resulted in garish but sometimes funny pieces. However, in the 1970s potterymaking was taken up again and endeavors in a number of directions were undertaken, influenced by examples from other pueblos. Decorating greenware and innovative slip colors  were shortlived experiments, while Mary Small and Mary E. Toya advocated traditional manufacture (Hayes and Blom 1996:80-83). In the 1990s Jemez pottery reached an artistic level comparable to other pueblos, although it still derives most forms, techniques and designs from neighbours. Polished redwares dominate, but a matte finish is also characteristic of some Jemez pottery.\r\n\r\nJemez is essentially closed to visitors, but the Walatowa Visitor Center that opened in 1995? welcomes travellers and provides information on history, culture and arts and crafts. It also contains a small sales area. The center has expanded the market for the craft, as do the open air markets during the summer, fall and winter months, the Jemez Red Rock Arts and Crafts Show (2nd weekend in June), the Fall Art Fiesta (2nd weekend in October), and the Walatowa Winter Arts and Crafts Show (1st weekend in December). In addition, educational adventures (Ed-Ventures) are organized for groups, focussing on archaeological sites, traditional food preparation, dances, storytelling, arts and crafts." .
