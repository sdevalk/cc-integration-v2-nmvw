The top is completely covered with coix seeds. The line in the middle of the back and two side lines are indicated by grey coix seeds. From the edges hang several strings with animal hair and halved coix seeds. There is a hole through the middle of the object indicating that it was carried on a stick above the bearer's head. A flexible stick (arib) was put through the hole and attached to the performer's headgear or placed on a wooden platform (humum) worn on his head. \r\n\r\nA much smaller ornament representing a snake was carried by the waiko-performer during the mayo cult dance - waiko-zi and connected with the re-enactment of a particular mythical episode during Marind cult celebrations. It is a clan emblem representing a totemic ancestor/animal, a small snake (possibly a grass snake). Its ritual significance and cultural symbolism is rooted in Marind mythology. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\nThe grass-snake is a small, brightly coloured snake called mayo-iwag; the name resembles- mayo mes-iwag, which means mythological women. Towards the end of the mayo-ceremony an effigy of a 'snake-like' woman (Van Baal, 1966: 505), which is referred to as mayo-iwag or mayo-mess-iwag is ritually burned in the mayo-fire, and symbolically eaten. This refers to cannibalism. Paradoxically, the mayo-fire is the fire which plays the central role in the myth of the origin of mankind. The fire symbolically connects death and birth. It ties in with Marind philosophy which holds that from death springs new life. \r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA , 28.11. 2006" .
