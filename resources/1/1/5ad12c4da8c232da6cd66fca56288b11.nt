Wordt als ruilmiddel gebruikt en ontleent zijn waarde grotendeels aan z'n ouderdom.\r\n\r\nThe use of beads is common around Lake Sentani, Humboldt Bay and until Vanimo on the New Guinea north coast. This kind of beads is not represented elsewhere in New Guinea. The most common are spherical  or discoidal yellow ones, keg shaped or cylindrical cobalt blue or transparent green-blue ones, and finally big spherical transparent green ones. \r\nThey are a part of the bride wealth gift with stone axes and glass bracelets (for a headman’s son). In 1903 Sande tried to acquired one glass bracelet in Tobadi but he did not obtain it even in exhange for 24 large axes. \r\nBeads were also among the trade goods used by foreigners. Binck wrote that they were ‘’articles with which one can get the Sentanier everything’’. According to Sande they are seldom worn as ornaments but sometimes in the nose, on combs and the front of men´s bag on particular occasion. \r\nThese kind of beads look like models made in China during the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). The authors think that the beads arrived in the region between 1644 and 1850. They are called  tena or senai which means old on Lake Sentani .They acquired their value, moteri, due to their antiquity.\r\nAt present there are more beads on Lake Sentani than in the coast. People from Humboldt Bay tried to marry Sentanier to obtain beads. People from the coast seems to be settled after the beads arrived. \r\nMyths about the origin of the beads told that they came from bead trees supplied by the ancestors and came, as them, from the east. Beads retain certain powers associated with the upper world hence their prominent role in society. \r\nThe author quoting Hoogerbrugge give a myth from Sentani :\r\n''When our forefathers still lived in the mountains to the east, they had a bead tree. When they moved from the east to the west they took with them their bead tree and planted it in the vicinity of Nafri on a hill. It was a large tree with beautiful flowers. After some time the area around the tree began to smell. It seemed that the tree was rotting and so they cut it down. When later generations were planting gardens they frequently found beads in the ground. They were the flowers from the bead tree of the ancestors''." .
