the larger the better.\r\nMen as well as woman wore bracelets.\r\nPoor indeed was the Navajo who did not have two or three bracelets.\r\nFrequently a well-to do Navajo would have a dozen or more bracelets, while he would only own one or two strand of beads or single set of moccasin buttons.\r\nIt is almost certain that the brass bracelets were made by the Navajo themselves as they required only a length of brass or copper wire and files to produce decorative grooved.\r\nSometimes two or three bands of wire were twisted together.\r\nIn the early days of silversmithing, bracelets were mainly brood and flat. \r\nThey were made of melted silver and wrought( hammered into) a single piece.\r\nAs the silver smith attained more knowledge of soldering and stamping many more complicated  forms were introduced.\r\nUp to that time  all the decorative patterns were achieved by using files and cold chisels, or with impressions with steel stamps ( also called  dies) These patterns were largely rectangulinear ( straight lines) because of the nature of the tools.\r\nNow with the stamps more linear patterns were applied to the metal straight and curved lines could be easily by applied.\r\nThe designs of the stamps were derived from Mexican workers' tools.\r\n\r\nThe setting of stones began about 1880 with the use of crude hammered bezels.\r\nBracelets more than other forms of jewelry  permit the use of large or multiple stones .\r\nFrom the turn of the century turquoise and other stone have been primary importance in bracelet design.\r\nFor the most part early bracelet design  were small and flat and set flush to the bezel.\r\nIn the 1910-1920s cabochon became prevalent.\r\n\r\nThe use of added decorative elements on bracelets and other articles is a good indicator of the date of the piece. \r\nFine double twisted wire jewelry bracelets were common from the teens on.\r\nThe twenties an thirties saw an elaborate design of fine twisted and spiral write and in the 1930s bead wire imitation rows often are drops was frequently added.\r\nPatterns composes of small segments of bent wire and applique ornaments appeared at about the same time\r\n\r\nThe stylistic development of Navajo Jewelry\r\nNavajo jewelry can be categorize into the following periods:\r\nFirst period : the classic period(1860-1910)\r\nJust when the Navajo started to work with silver is still a very debated subject. \r\nNo written record tells us exactly when Navajo metal smithing began. \r\nIt is generally assumed, however, that before 1850 the Navajo obtained their metal jewelry through trade with the Plains Pueblo and Mexican peoples.\r\nThe incarceration at Bosque Redondo(1864-1868) also influenced the development of Navajo metal smiting. \r\nOne of the earliest smith are: ATSIDI SANI ( old smith) and ATSIDI CHON( Ugly smith) astsi  Sni is generally recognized as the first Navajo to have mastered metal smiting techniques.\r\nAs a student of Nakai  Tsosi( Slender Mexican) worked solely with iron  forging bridles and bits for trade. \r\nAtsidi SANI persisted in developing his skill during the years of confinement at Bosque Redondo, and Navajo men were indeed given tools for blacksmithing tools. \r\nAtside Sani was among several Navajo blacksmiths who ran to forges on the reservation and helped teach the craft to others. \r\nA small amount of brass copper and silver jewelry appears to have been made during this period.\r\n\r\nAfter their release from Bosque Redondo many Navajo continued to work as blacksmiths and some eventually began silverworking. \r\nAll mid 19th century Navajo silver was hand hammered.\r\nAmerican coins, Mexican pesos or ingots were mainly used  until the 1920's when various thickness of sheet silver and wire were introduced.\r\n\r\nAnother pioneer in Navajo silverworking was Atsidi Chon or \"Ugly smith\".\r\nHe was probably the first Navajo to create a horse bridle of silver(around 1870) and he also may have fashioned the first concha belt. \r\nAround 1872,  Atsisi Chon taught the craft to the Zuni smith Lanyade.\r\nIn 1880, Atsid Chon or an apprentice named Peshlakai Atsidi(or Slender- Maker- of- sliver) was the first to set a turquoise stone in a silver bezel\r\n\r\nDuring the classic period, the form of silver pieces and also their decoration came to have iconography  significance. \r\nThe colors of certain stones, such as turquoise and coral and the use of four decorative elements in a design became associated with the cardinal directions.\r\nDouble or paired forms suggested the relationship of earth and sky; six elements, for example a row of six tones echoed the six inner forms of the sacred mountains.\r\n\r\nOutside influence\r\nThe Navajo obtained materials for metalwork through trade.\r\nLong-established trade systems with neighboring tribes and Mexican smiths provide them not only with necessary metals- iron, brass, copper and silver- but also with an array of metal forms and designs. \r\nAmerican and Mexican silver coins,  for instance,  were used to create the earliest silver jewelry.\r\nThe Navajo concha, pomegranate( squash blossom button)  cross canteen and motifs for bridle decorations were not unique inventions of the Navajo\r\nThey were borrowed  and reproduced by the Navajo from the Plains and Mexican tribes. Often valuable goods and services were exchanged for silver.\r\nFor instance,  for their iron and silver ornaments, livestock and  fruit the Navajo received turquoise and shells from the Pueblos. \r\n\r\n\r\nTools\r\nDespite their crude tools the early silversmiths developed and perfected their limited metal working techniques and often would invent new ones.\r\nThey acquired tools through trade or ingeniously construct them, fashioning bellows from goatskin and wood, molding forges from stick and mud and chapping crucibles from clay and sherd. \r\nThey also forged blowpipes from brass wires, chisels and stamps from railroad spikes and nails, and anvils from scarp iron and wood.\r\nBy 1870 the Navajo had mastered techniques such as annealing and soldering and had learned how to embellish their designs with stones\r\nMost importantly they invented the tufa-casting technique, in which silver coins and slugs were poured from crucibles into intricately carves sandstone moulds. \r\nThis technique allowed them to produce a wide range of shapes and designs that otherwise would not have been possible.\r\nEarly silverwork is distinguished  by utter simplicity of both composition and technique due partly to the smiths preference and the limit of tools and materials. \r\nMost of the Conchas and buttons for instance are round. Bracelets tend to be wide and heavy. \r\nEarly artisans  applied surface design by chasing, filing, and engraving and they attempted to add diversity and three dimensionality by stamping with simple crescent, round and sunburst pattern dies. \r\nAs new tools and techniques became more accessible and familiar to them the redefined borrowed motifs to reflect their own culture.\r\n\r\nDuring the classic period(1860-1910) the form of silver pieces and also their decoration came to have iconography significance. \r\nThe colors of certain stones such as turquoise and coral and the use of four decorative elements in a design became associated with the cardinal directions.\r\nDoubled or paired forms suggested the relationship of earth and sky;  six elements for example a rows of six stones echoed the six inner form of the sacred mountains. \r\n\r\nBy the early 1900s the availability of new tools and the mastery of new techniques allowed silversmiths a great range of artistic expression in design and form.\r\nApplying other techniques of repoussé chasing filing stamping and embossing and stone stetting to create elegant and aesthetic pieces\r\n\r\nSecond period:, the period of commercialization (1910-1940)\r\nThe second period in the development of Navajo metal smithing was characterized by economic intervention, exploration and commercialization that almost in some retrospect almost extinguished the native tradition.\r\n\r\nThe white trader's appearance on the reservation during the 1870 had provided a new means of exchange and communication. \r\nAs the traditional system of trade gradually shifted in the direction of external economy. \r\nThe Navajo's bargaining position became dependent on the trader's cash flow and line of credit and on supply and demand of the outside market.\r\nWhen the demand for wool, sheep, jewelry and textile declined elsewhere, so did the prices traders offered for the Navajo goods and livestock. \r\nThe result was a diminished cash flow for their trader and a decreasing line of credit for the Navajo consumer.\r\n\r\nMoreover the rising commercial tourist trade demanded inexpensive Indian-made curios and by 1915 cities such Albuquerque, Gallup, Flagstaff and other cities along the Santa Fe Railroad had become bustling centers of commerce and trade in the Indian arts.\r\nLocal hotels and company such as the Fred Harvey Company, Maisel and Sun-Bell  catered to the growing tourist markets furnished native artisans with an array of new tools, material and techniques.\r\nAlthough in the past increased access to tools and materials had inspired silversmith to cultivate Navajo design and techniques, during this period commercialization an economic exploitation discouraged authentic Navajo expression.\r\nCast work ,for instance, disappeared almost entirely.Hammering takes less time. \r\nSmiths, who were usually paid by ounces of silver made up, naturally used the quickest methods. \r\nBeauty of workmanship counted for  nothing, so they crafted their product to the needs of the  trader. \r\nSome vendors did offer bonuses for good work, but they were few.\r\nThe need for financial security forced, however, native artisans to accept work in commercial jewelry businesses that mass produced curios for tourist.\r\nNative craftsmen for coerced into adapting non traditional motives ( swastikas, bows and arrows, thunderbirds) and non traditional forms( boxes, letter openers ashtrays, combs and beetle pins. \r\nThese bench pieces are characterized by their redundant form, repetitive design and unrestrained decoration. \r\n\r\nThinning the silver destroyed the traditional regard for proportion and simplicity gave way to the lower standards of mass production, resulting in era of technically and artistically inferior silverware. \r\nFrom 1900-1920, as more people  journeyed across the continent by train, a cheap, lightweight ring or bracelet with a stone or two was a favorite souvenir.\r\nIt became indeed a stereotype of the Southwestern Indian.\r\nYet as the tourists industry dwindled during the depression years, silver production diminished an the metal working tradition was nearly lost.\r\nSilversmithing was not the only aspect of Navajo life adversely affected by economic conditions.\r\n A scarcity of jobs on the reservation , combined with the reduction of sheep herds forced by the government , imperiled the very nature of the traditional Navajo culture and economy. More than ever , bother personal and newly fashioned jewelry as used as collateral at the trading post so the Navajo could purchase the requisite blankets and food as more an more Navajo locked the means to redeem their pawned jewelry. \r\n\r\nThird period: the period of modernization (1940- present)\r\nBy the 1930,the technology for making jewelry changed rapidly, in part due to the availability of electricity.\r\nHand turned grinding and buffing wheels were replaced by electrically driven equipment. Additional fine lapidary equipment and jewelry tools, many imported form Europe allowed the Zuni tribe to do even more precise inlay and mosaic work more quickly.\r\nAfter WWII, the refineries shipped silver to jewelry supply houses in Gallup, Albuquerque, Scottsdale, Flagstaff and other mercantile centers. \r\nSheet silver and wire in many different gauges purchases at rendered the practice of hammering out slugs and drawing by hand obsolete.\r\nTo these same supply stores, machine shaped and polished turquoise was shipped from mines all over Arizona, Nevada and Colorado.\r\n\r\nWhereas the jewelry made prior to 1945 was most part sold to tourists at trading posts ands shops in the southwest, increasingly after 1945 jewelry ash trays tableware cigarette boxes were sold through sales men hire by wholesale traders and earlier in distant cities from the reservation.\r\nSince the 1960s southwestern jewelry has become fashionable all over the United States and has even reached shops in Europe and Japan.\r\nIn the years following WWII, the Navajo enjoyed a wider of range of educational opportunities. \r\nThey requested and received classroom instruction in Navajo art, culture and history and Navajo arisen and participated in the variety of programs at the Wingage Guild,(1930-1940). \r\nFor instance well-known silversmiths were employed to teach the craft to youngsters.\r\nEven today ,schools still  encourages excellence in design and craftsman.\r\nContemporary Navajo smith are more individualistic in their approach and may apply traditional designs with western techniques\r\n\r\nEconomics of the craft\r\nAt the end of the nineteenth century silversmithing had spread throughout the southwestern tribes. \r\nIt became very fashionable to wear silver jewelry in abundance on ceremonial and special occasions, mixing it with beads of turquoise shell and coral. \r\nIn the early days of silversmithing it was difficult if not impossible to get the metal out of its ores. \r\nMost silver came from the Navajos in the form of coins that they received in trade  or by raiding neighboring tribes. \r\nSilver like coral had become more valuable to trade than sheep and horses, it was considered a hard commodity ( as opposed to a \"soft\" commodities such as livestock)\r\nAt a  time when the Navajo just learned the craft, from the Mexicans   the price of making a silver ring for instance, was one sheep. A concha belt was worth at least 20 sheep. \r\nLater on silver was also used to barter or as item to pawn at local trading posts.\r\nThe pawn system was a type of credit whereby a Navajo could leave his jewelry as security against his purchases. \r\nIn a cash-poor society this form of exchange allowed the Navajo to weather the lean months before the harvest or the sheering of sheep earned him enough money to clear his debt.\r\nIt was understood that an individual could redeem his jewelry for ceremonial occasions and it would be returned afterward to remain his bond until his debts were paid.\r\nOften the jewelry would stay at the trading post for years and was displayed on racks behind the counter\r\n\r\nLater regulations (1936) were passed specifying the length of time a trader had to keep the jewelry before it was legal to release it for outside sale, at which point it became \"Dead pawn. \r\nThe more lavish pawn  pieces were particularly bought by  many collectors and museum curators and tourists \r\nThe term \"Old pawn\" generally refers to the jewelry made before 1900\r\n\r\n\r\nTerms\r\nStamping: Decoration of a silver surface by striking it with a small metal die bearing a raised pattern\r\nApplique: A small decorative element soldered to a silver object\r\n\r\nRepoussé: Raising the surface of metal by hammering out from behind and the refining the design on the front by further hammering and file work.\r\n\r\nJacklas, A small loop of turquoise beads that hangs from, the bottom of a chunk turquiose necklace. They used to be worn separately as earrings\r\n\r\nStamp: A tool with a design on the end that is used to impress a patter on metal work or leather\r\nThis particular Navajo bracelet with three stone set turquoise stones dates form around 1900.\r\n\r\nsquash blossom. The shape often found on necklace side  pendants, said to resemble the flower of a squash or pumpkin. The design probably is derived form the Spanish or Mexican prototypes and if anything represents a pomegranate flower\r\n\r\nDouble  barred cross; an early form of pendant with a vertical member crossed by two horizontal pieces. The design may be Christian symbol or a stylized dragon fly- symbol for water among the southwest Indians\r\n\r\nBezel: A vertical wall of silver used to hold a stone in place on jewelry( Indian term is housing)" .
