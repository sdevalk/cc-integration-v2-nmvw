This basket is rather flat like a dish. This basket has as decoration an open-work rim with triangles at the top. This rim sticks out. This exemplar has an attached foot which is made in the same way as the bowl itself.\r\nBasketry-making was the job of men. \r\nThose baskets were used as a bowl for storage or short-distance transport of plant food, especially fruit. These baskets without Parinarium coat are probably left unfinished, because Europeans liked them better." .
