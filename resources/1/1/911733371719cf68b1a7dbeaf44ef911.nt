<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/704365b896f57b090c56a9e1a5266fdd> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "A statue made of wood. Among the few surviving jaraik in western collections this is perhaps the most refined and most archaic one. It has been carved with an adze in one flat piece from a gigantic buttress root and was masterly elaborated with a machete and a carving knife in an openwork technique allowing for decorative additions. The basic form consists of two broad upward branching arms opposed to two thin downward curving elements. The broad middle part has below a hole accommodating a monkey skull. It raises trunk-like in between the arms, ending, as do the arms themselves, in bifurcate protuberances like fingers. The surface is carefully smoothed, decorated with two incised seven-pronged stars, with linear designs in black and red, and with affixed pieces of mother of pearl.\r\nThe place for this powerful sacred object was above the doorway to the second inner room of the communal house, marking the entry into the space where the women and young children traditionally sleep.\r\nThe jaraik could be acquired in 1967 by Reimar Schefold from the Maileppet clan because the group was about to construct a new longhouse (uma) where there was no place for the old object. They had been converted to Christianity and were intimidated by the Indonesian Governmentâ€™s ban on the old animistic heritage. According to tradition a jaraik was a sacred and powerful agent in preventing evil forces from entering an uma. It was also supposed to attract positive influences, a faculty that was attributed to the efficacy of the ritual treatment of the inserted skull of a specific kind of monkey called bokkoi (Macaca nemestrina). The acquisition of such a skull was part of a collective hunt initiating the intricate and secret consecration ritual for a new jaraik that required contributions in work and food from all group members and was to impart to the object its magical properties. \r\n(Reimar Schefold, 2016)" .
