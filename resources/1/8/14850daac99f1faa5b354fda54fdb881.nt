Mary as a potter, and Bill as a drum maker and teacher of Pueblo language and traditions at various educational institution in and outside Cochiti.\r\nBill learned the art and craft of two-headed drum making from his grandfather, and he taught his grandson Ruben the elementary principles. He witnessed the growing separation between the youth and their tribal traditions, as modern society weaned them gradually away and made increasing demands on them. Watching TV and movies and playing computer games became favorite pastimes. The need for higher education and jobs necessitates them to move to urban centers. If they stay they become dependent on welfare and face poverty. Bill comments: “We’re trying to retain our culture, but this is very difficult. … When you lose the elders, many things go, like knowledge, like wisdom, the skills. … The challenge as parents is to integrate children into our culture. … There are no books that tell you which steps to follow. It takes a lot of things you learn from the people who take it from experience” (Ramirez 1995).\r\nKatherine D.
