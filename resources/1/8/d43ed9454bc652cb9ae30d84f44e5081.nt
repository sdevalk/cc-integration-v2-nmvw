He was the founder of Communist China, and its leader until his death. In 1966, Mao initiated the Cultural Revolution. This program to remove \"counter-revolutionary\" elements in Chinese society lasted 10 years and was marked by violent class struggle, widespread destruction of cultural artifacts, and an unprecedented elevation of Mao's cult of personality. The program is now officially regarded as a \"severe setback\" for the PRC.  After the Cultural Revolution, the Communist Party acknowledged that Mao had made ‘gross mistakes’  but that ‘his contributions to the Chinese revolution on the whole far outweigh his mistakes. His merits are primary and his errors secondary.’ Many people in China continue to have portraits of Mao in their homes as a symbol of their admiration of ‘the Great Helmsman’ (duoshou 舵手) . Depictions of Mao (such as portraits but also sculptures and oneveryday items) are also popular as memorabilia and collectables inside and outside China today. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHannah Li, April 2019" .
