Their deep and resonant sound marked the sanctity of the moment, a state of tapu, and the presence of gods. The prominence of sinnet (coconut fibre) binding in their making was not merely a physical means of holding the sharkskin tympanum in place, but a further expression of their tapu nature: binding, like wrapping, reinforced and contained divine efficacy (mana). Drums in this tall, intricately carved style were made by exceptionally accomplished carvers on the island of Ra'ivavae and were among valuables traded between the Austral Islands and Tahiti, some 435 miles to the north before the encounter with Europeans. This example however was made with tools incorporating introduced iron, but before conversion to Christianity led Islanders to surrender sacred drums to missionaries or give them away in trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts, p. 287)\r\n\r\nSkin drums, membranophones, are widespread in East Polynesia, where a hollowed cylinder stands on a footed base often carved with crescents, which are thought to have housed the drum's spiritual strength and mana. The skins are bound to the base with sacred cords of braided coconut fibre. The drums called pahu or pa√∫ were played to announce important births, open and close wars, and mark funerals. Ritual movements of priests used their rythm and theyh were used in association with dancing. In the Austral Islands, the cylinder is sometimes covered with finely woven pandanus leaves which incorporate geometric designs and the carved bases incorporate human figures and crescents that echo the joined arms of the figures\r\n\r\n(Kaeppler A.L., The Pacific Arts of Polynesia and Micronesia, Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 50)\r\n\r\nDrums and similar percusssion instruments have always provided a major part of the music for dancingm rituals and religious ceremonies in the Pacific Islands. Ranging form small Hawaiian drums that rest upon the knee to huge slit-gongs carved from whole tree trunks in Vanuatu and New Guinea, these instruments continue as a distinctive feature of performances in the Pacific today.  .(...) Only about dozen of these early drums survive.\r\n\r\n(Newell Jenny,Pacific Art in Detail, The British Museum Press, 2011, p.102)" .
