Basket making is a women's craft with specific rules designating which women are allowed to make a special kind of basket. For example, grandmothers or older women past menopause can make certain baskets to protect the power of the medicine. This basket is made by using the coiling basket-making technique. Thick bundles of sweet-grass (Hierochloe R. Br.) are sewn together with colored thread.  \t\r\nThe grass is cut during the drier months of the year and laid out to dry for several days. The green grass turns yellow when dried and at that point it is ready for use. Grass lengths are evened out and selected to form coils. The commercial thread which is often colored is pulled through beeswax to make it stronger and to prevent it from strangling. The thread is stitched into the preceding coil and wound around the new coil. It is then pulled on an angle over to the next spot to be stitched, the angled thread forming a V. Any color thread is used. Sometimes a lid, handles or forms of ornamentation are added. In this case, the handles are extinctions of the coils that form the body of the basket. It is generally assumed that this technique is not native to the Southeast. African slaves who lived among or near the Seminoles might have introduced them to this technique in the nineteenth century. These slaves had escaped or were stolen by the Seminoles. The Seminoles had no interest in keeping slaves and the Africans paid only a small tribute every year as a protection against whites. These so called 'Black Seminoles' or Seminole Maroons developed their own distinctive culture and society with European, African and Indian influences.\t\tThe Episcopal deaconess Harriet Bedell inspired a wave of new interest in basket weaving in the 1930's when she encouraged women to use the plants that grew around them to make baskets to sell to tourists. She emphasized the importance of high-quality so that people could take pride in the items they made and to boost their economy. Bedell was very concerned about the poverty stricken Seminoles and stimulated them to sell their own handicrafts. These inexpensive sweet-grass baskets became quickly popular with tourists and are still a major source of income to some families." .
