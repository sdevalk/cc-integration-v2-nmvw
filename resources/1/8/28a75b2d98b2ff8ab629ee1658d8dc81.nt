The hollowed out and smoothed coconut is parted in half (not necessarily evenly). A carved wooden ladle of different size and adornment is glued to the coconut. The manufacture was the work of the men, as is almost all carving  and wood work. The handle is attached to the outside of the coconut shell. It is long and thin and has a quadrangular diameter. The whole ladle has no decorations. It is curved backwards away from the coconut.  \r\nThe ladle was used to scoop liquids and solid food from pots and kettles, often from a big wooden bowl. This was often done on feasts, to give out soup to guests. The ladles were kept in the house of the men and were sometimes a present to guests." .
