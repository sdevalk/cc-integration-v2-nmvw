Inside, a powdery red dye was stored and transported. \r\nRed dye usually was some kind of red soil or red iron ore, which were found on the main island Manus. Certain plants (e.g. Bixa orellana) could also serve as a source for red colour. \r\n\r\nMany objects like weapon handles, wooden bowls and ladles, ancestral figures or even the human body itself would be dyed red. \r\nDye was a trading good, as certain natural colours would only be found in one particular place. Before the Europeans traded with the indigenous people of the Admiralty Islands, there was only red, black, yellow and white." .
