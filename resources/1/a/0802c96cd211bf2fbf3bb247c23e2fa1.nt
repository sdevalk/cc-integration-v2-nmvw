Siwes' distinctive images of Adelaide's urban milieux, landmarks and cultural landscapes, into which he places his own image as a kind of uncanny, ghostly, but also, epiphany-like contemporary Aboriginal presence have become emblematic of his photography. What renders these photographs \"distinctly Siwes\" is his absolute refusal of the stereotype: Siwes' \"contemporary Aboriginal man\" most emphatically does not stand on one leg, clad in nothing but a loincloth, holding a fistful of boomerangs and spears while looking longingly out at the blue beyond towards the hopping kangaroos on the Adelaide Plains. Instead, Siwes' Aboriginal Man wears a suit and tie, or sometimes an elegant long coat, looking for all the world like he would be equally at home in the privileged world of Vogue fashion shoots, or attending business lunches or church on Sunday. In fact, the persona being projected is somewhere between the younger versions of Jeff Kennett and Jimmy Little - conservative, quietly composed and in control, and calmly looking out at the viewer. An unequivocally contemporary presence, this man belongs in the world that he has created with his camera.\r\n\r\nThis youngish man frequently announces himself to the world by standing frontally and looking straight at the camera, and therefore, by extension, towards the viewer. Siwes arranges his shots like that - there is a high level of intentionality in every photograph. Each shot is thoroughly and painstakingly composed - there is nothing accidental or left to chance about where Siwes places his camera in relation to the buildings and monuments that he photographs. Darren Siwes carefully selects his sites and chooses where to place his camera, and the choice is always a strategic one. Equally, the leitmotif 'man in the photograph' is at the same time phantasmagoric and real; a mnemonic trace, but also, a substantial, living presence. It is the tension that exists between Siwes' subject matter - the continuing Indigenous presence on this land at contemporary sites of significance - and his presentation of glossy images of well-known locations in today's Adelaide, which gives his photographs their special edge.\r\n\r\nIn his work, Darren Siwes manages to be intensely personal yet also to speak on a broader artistic level. For example, one does not need to know that Siwes is of Ngalkban heritage, or even to identify him as the figure in the landscape to appreciate these works. Moreover, whilst his locations are instantly recognizable for those who live in Adelaide, it is quite possible to appreciate Darren Siwes' remarkable photographic images with little or no understanding of Adelaide's cultural geography. Neither does one need to be well versed in recent local Kaurna history, although such knowledge brings with it an extra dimension of insight into Siwes art. At the same time, Siwes' photographic subject - the figure in the landscape - also acts as a kind of narrator. What exactly we as viewers, might learn from that narration depends on the extent to which we are prepared to apply ourselves, to free ourselves from misrecognition and stereotypic understandings, in other words, it is dependent on our willingness to decolonize our own minds. That is the implicit challenge of Siwes' art.\r\n\r\n\r\nGagprojects" .
