The use of aluminium for cooking ware has declined since the speculation in the 1980s that it would cause dementia. \r\n\r\n Aluminium lunch boxes are easy to carry thus are used as a substitute of bowls and plates. \r\n\r\nWoven nets played the role of plastic bags before they were invented. They were used to carry various kind of stuff around, and also functioned as shopping bags. They have recently made a comeback in organic stores (as eco-friendly alternatives to plastic bags) and in fashion designs.
