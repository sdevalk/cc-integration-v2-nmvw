<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1181-31> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The ladle is made of half a coconut shell and a wooden ladle. The hollowed out and smoothed coconut is parted in half (not necessarily evenly). A carved wooden ladle of different size and adornment is glued to the coconut. The manufacture was the work of the men, as is almost all carving  and wood work. \r\nDifferent kinds of adornments can be identified. They most probable don't have a special meaning, but are expression of the artist's creativity.\r\nThis handle is glued to the outside of the coconut and it sticks out in a right angle to the rim of the coconut. The back is curved and shows some openwork. Two spirals lie on the inward side. The two spirals are symmetrically placed on both sides of a horizontal bar. The spiral is a frequent motif on wooden work and can be found on canoe prows and wooden bowls. There are different conceivable inspirations for the spirals. It could represent the curled tail of a marsupial, the coil of a sea snail, a boar's tusks or fern fiddleheads. The handles have the form of an ornament, which can also be found on the prow and stern of a canoe. The bottom part has carved openwork. The connection to canoes is important, as both were associated with clans and clan symbols. The patterns could have been clan insignia.\r\nThe ladle was used to scoop liquids and solid food from pots and kettles, often from a big wooden bowl. This was often done on feasts, to give out soup to guests. The ladles were kept in the house of the men and were sometimes a present to guests." .
