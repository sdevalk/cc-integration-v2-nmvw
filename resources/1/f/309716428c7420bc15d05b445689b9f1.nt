Cut in half and cured, the two compartments were filled with small pebbles, and sewn onto a buckskin thong that was wound around the ankle by dancers (cf. Densmore 1932: plate 29; Fabila 1940:218-219; Spicer 1940:180; 1980:110; 1983:258; Kolaz 1985:40; Painter 1986:245-246; Choate 1997:98).\r\n362-12, 56, 57, 58 Pascola artifacts\r\nThe Hispanicized Indian term pascola is derived from the Cahitan pahko o ola, meaning \"old man of the fiesta\" (Spicer 1940:174), and the term refers as well to the character as to the dance he performs. Masked ritual clowns have been a part of Yaqui ceremonials for many centuries, and later developed into the pascolas. They perform a variety of roles at different ceremonial occasions: as clowns, ceremonial hosts, and dancers at different occasions, including Easter festivities, and are central to Yaqui ethnic identity (e.g. Spicer 1940:182-189; 1954:76-77,183-184; Barker 1957). The dance is syncretistic, combining traditional Indian and Christian elements. Ten Kate's description of a Yaqui pascola performance, although rather short, is one of the earliest anthropological accounts of this dance that is performed annually during the season of Lent, shortly before Easter. The pascolas and their performances have drawn widespread interest as a multitude of publications testify, including several scientific studies from different perspectives (e.g. Bogan 1925; Spicer 1940:173-203; Painter 1986; Griffith and Molina 1980). Bronislaw Malinowski who was in Tucson in 1939 to consider a position with the University of Arizona's Anthropology Department, wrote a functionalist analysis of the Yaqui Easter Fiesta and the pascolas he saw perform at Old Pasqua Village (Troy 1998:178-180). In the 1930s an interdisciplinary group of researchers from Texas and Harvard University did fieldwork among the Sonora Yaquis and gathered a contemporary collection of artifacts for the Texas Technological College in Lubbock (now: Texas Tech University) and the Peabody Museum in Boston (Holden et.al. 1936:11).\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)\r\n\r\nEnkelversiering in de vorm van rammelende poppen van een vlinder aan leren snoeren.
