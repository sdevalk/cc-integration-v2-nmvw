Behalve aan de punten geheel bedekt met ingesneden figuren : zes rondgaande ringen met spiralen, waartussen driehoeken met strepen. Een rond stokje, puntig toelopend en met een wit katoenen lap omwikkeld, dient als spatel.\r\n\r\nLime containers were among the possession of nearly every man and woman. Most followed the custom of chewing lime and the betel nut as a kind of stimulant.\r\nMost of the lime containers were made from the lagenaria gourd. Yet, the wives of chiefs possessed lime containers made of coconut shell. They were completely covered by an incised decorations, the pattern being formed by the ridges. The incision might be rubbed with lime. The decoration was done by specialists.\r\nAll lime gourds were provided with spatula which is missing here. These instrument vary in shape from undecorated sticks to objects with elaborately carved handles.\r\nBetel chewing is still common practice. The  plastic cups or empty beer cans replaced the former materials. \r\nAlmost all artefacts in the Sentani region were adorned with engravings, paintings or burned with figurative and geometrical designs, often interlocking spiral ornaments (referred to as fouw). These decorations are labelled as homo, a term that can be translated as ‘’writing’’ and refers both to sculpting and painting.  In addition to aesthetically enhancing artefacts, homo give information about the person, family, and village who owned the object. Specific designs were used by particular groups of people and passed on from one generation to another. Each family or clan had its own designs that were kept. In addition, political alliances between villages were visualised by the use of specific designs. Designs and ornaments have mythological origins. This is suggested by local narratives in which decorations often figure in relation to spirits and  ancestors. The clans used to hold control over  the reproduction of the animal’s images." .
