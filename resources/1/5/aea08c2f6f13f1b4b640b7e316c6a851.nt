<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/237c66e9b304525e2d5dcf2ab7697cfc> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Sokari’s work is at the center of cultural crossroads; it combines African and European influences, both in style and content. This recent Jonkonnu sculpture is reminiscent of the Caribbean carnival tradition, which in itself is a cross-over of African, European and Caribbean (Jamaican) forms and traditions. In the 2015 Carnival exhibition in the Afrika Museum we showed the contemporary carnival figure of Jonkonnu and it’s origins in Africa together with (a reproduction of) the famous Belisario print of a Jamaican Jonkonnu (also written as John-Canoe) dancer. The Jonkonnu is a form of blending, “indicative of the creolization process.”.\r\nThe house on top of the dancer’s head can be seen as a reminder of a colonial plantation owner’s mansion, but also refers in form sometimes to a boat, more reminiscent of the transatlantic trade in enslaved people.\r\nArtist statement: “Inspired by my internet search, this piece is a combination of the images I found on the internet. A man in a military jacket with a sash on his toes; seeming as if he is doing an Irish jig. What excited me was the headdress, looking like a long boat but also looking like a house. I have put tea logos on this headdress Yorkshire Tea, Liptons, PG tips. These are quintessential British teas and that is what amuses me, our colonial history is at the core of our being. Combining us, as members of the same family, the same planet and yet our paths are different.”" .
