Door de heer Witte ter plaatse verzameld in maart 1953.\r\n\r\nThe bones used for daggers are sometimes human femurs but more frequently cassowary tibiotarsi. \r\nThe part of the cassowary tibiotarsus generally used is also the shaft extending upward from the condyle. The shafts of daggers are often marked with patterns or images, the most important area of which is placed below the condyle on the anterior surface. This is the natural position for the hand to grip the weapon, and it is more than likely that physical contact with the designs was believed to provide supernatural reinforcement to the wielder. \r\nThe daggers were highly charged with supernatural and symbolic affects – like many other items of New Guinea material culture which made them fit objects to be used in ritual and magic. At the same time, daggers had the primary purpose of killing people. They were mainly used for finishing off victims brought down by arrows or spears, or marked for assassination, by stabbing them in the neck or behind the clavicle. \r\nThe cassowary was taboo to the men of Humboldt Bay and Lake Sentani who had been initiated into the secret rituals: none of them would kill or eat it. \r\nThe cassowary was identified with the uaropo (the spirit of the men's house) who devoured the boys and afterwards gave them back as a man. \r\nAt the time of the festival for the novices, when the flutes were played, sticks decorated with cassowary feathers were thrust out through the palm-leaf roof and waved about, as a visible demonstration of the deadly game played by the uaropo.\r\nThe spiral ornaments decorating the dagger are labelled as homo, a term that can be translated as ‘’writing’’ and refers both to sculpting and painting.  In addition to aesthetically enhancing artefacts, homo give information about the person, family, and village who owned the object. Specific designs were used by particular groups of people and passed on from one generation to another. Each family or clan had its own designs that were kept. In addition, political alliances between villages were visualised by the use of specific designs. Designs and ornaments have mythological origins. This is suggested by local narratives in which decorations often figure in relation to spirits and  ancestors. The clans used to hold control over  the reproduction of the animal’s images. Almost all artefacts in the Sentani region were adorned with these kind of engravings, paintings or burned with figurative and geometrical designs, often interlocking spiral ornaments (referred to as fouw).  \r\nAccording to Douglas Newton, the distribution of the dagger in the whole of New Guinea is still hard to define. Neither anthropologists' reports nor museum collections are as complete as one could wish. Even so, it would seem that the Sepik Provinces (one should include the area of Humboldt Bay, now on the west side of the international border, and the Ramu River and its tributaries) were the part of the country where daggers were most prevalent. Elsewhere on the island daggers were made in a limited stretch of the south coast, from the Asmat region to the eastern border of the Gulf of Papua. In the mountainous central highlands they were used by only a few groups, who were possibly influenced in this respect by the coastal people." .
