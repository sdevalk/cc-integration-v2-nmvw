<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/3c001ac9e8bb35e09fcdffa5a1d8d49d> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This piece was commissioned during the contemporary art commission of the Re-Design of the Volkenkunde Museum in 1999, with funding from the Public Works 1% rule. \r\n\r\nThe artist, Andries Botha, hoped to bring attention to the systems of classification, and the classic methods of anthropological and ethnology work which underpinned the Colonial project of the Netherlands during the colonial era. In this reverse ethnology process he came to the Netherlands as an ‘outsider’ hoping to acquire objects of material culture and relocate them from their surroundings as encased and enshrouded materialisms of colonial by-product.  \r\n\r\n    The metal cages house objects of \"traditional Dutch culture\" and ritual. He features concepts and image as diverse as Speculaas cookies, just one on a plate to signify that Dutch tradition of hospitality, and frugality. Amongst other themes are an Ajax football, a group of Kabouters, and other objects of kitsch. He casts these objects in South Africa and brings them back to the Netherlands in a reverse ethnographic practice. As well he documented his trip to the Netherlands in a book he named Oranje Blanje Bleu, where he documents his trip in excruciating ethnographic detail, a practice of reversals. \r\n\r\nThese pieces line the entrance path to the museum bringing attention to dynamics within the walls of the museum, positioning the museum instead of as authority, under question. \r\n\r\nHe remarks on his own work on his artist website: \r\n\r\n“This installation is part of a series of works commissioned by the Rijksakademie Voor Volkenkunde(Garden of Eden Project). My intention was to reflect upon the relationship between the colonial centre and the periphery (colony). I explored the historical relationship between the Netherlands and South Africa as a metaphorical example of these complex colonial relationships. I also wish to take note of the complexity of repositioning cultural artefacts within a postcolonial discourse. I collected a series of objects on a “colonial safari”, brought these back to South Africa, iconised them by transforming my “trophies” into durable material. Meticulous archival notes were kept about the provenance of each of the objects. This documentation was transformed into a travel journal which accompanies this work and is now lodged in the Museum Archive/Library, in addition to providing the information which also appears on the installation as inscribed information onto aluminium plates. Each object(s) is displayed in its own viewing station and is accompanied by a detailed explanation of the material and physical circumstances under which I collected/curated the artefact.\r\n \r\nI used the Afrikaans language, a derivative of Dutch, as the theoretical text throughout the work as an abiding memory of the historical colonial relationship between Holland and South Africa.\r\n \r\nBeneath the subtext of humour and the banality of fixing anthropological notions of the Other lies the important scrutiny of race and identity and all the power relationships attached to that.”" .
