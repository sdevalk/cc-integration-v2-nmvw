These were used by women to carry ollas to and from the river, to ease the weight of the vessels and stabilize them during transportation. In the home these rings were used as pot stands (Stevenson 1883:369, fig. 486).\r\n362-151, 152, 153 Zuni basketry\r\n\tTen Kate's negative judgement of the quality of Zuni basketry was shared by his contemporary Colonel James Stevenson (1883:334) who collected 200 baskets at Zuni in 1879 and 1880 for the Smithsonian Institution. In a modern study, Andrew Hunter Whiteford (1988:158-163) concurs, albeit noting some rare exceptions, such as coiled baskets in the shape of small ollas with a two-rod-and-bundle foundation. The shallow wicker peach baskets in which decorative use is made of the light-colored rabbit brush and red willow to create a checkered pattern is also aesthetically pleasing (cf. Herold 2005:93-94,162).\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)\r\n\r\nMatten draagring, wordt op het hoofd geplaatst om vaatwerk e.d. te dragen." .
