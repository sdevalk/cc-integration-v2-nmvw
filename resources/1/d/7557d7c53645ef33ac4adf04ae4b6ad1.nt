It is made from a single piece of wood, with the exception of the end parts of the wings which are attached to the main part by means of small wedges of hard wood. The surface is ornamented with red, white and black pigment. On the sides, the object is decorated with fibre strings with seeds to which ends the feathers are attached. There is a square hole in the middle indicating that it was carried on a stick above the bearer's head. The flexible stick (arib) was put through the hole and attached to the performer's headgear or placed on a wooden platform (humum) worn on his head.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            \r\nThis ceremonial object was carried by the waiko-performer during ritual dances - waiko-zi connected with re-enactment of a particular mythical episode in the context of the mayo cult celebration.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe ornament is a clan emblem possibly representing a totemic bird which is difficult to specify. Therefore its particular bearer/dema-performer and its cultural symbolism derived from the myths cannot be determined.\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 20.11. 2006" .
