<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1181-35> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The ladle is made of half a coconut shell and a wooden ladle. The hollowed out and smoothed coconut is parted in half (not necessarily evenly). A carved wooden ladle of different size and adornment is glued to the coconut. The manufacture was the work of the men, as is almost all carving  and wood work. \r\nDifferent kinds of adornments can be identified. They most probable don't have a special meaning, but are expression of the artist's creativity. Animal or human figures are probably an allusion to ancestral beings and totems. The broad side of the handle sticks out from the rim of the shell and is facing backwards. It is attached to the outside of the coconut. It clearly shows the whole body of a crocodile with tail, feet and head. Its mouth is opened and shows teeth. A scroll marks the upper end of the handle. The crocodile is one of the most important ancestral beings which created the earth and everything that is on it today. It is naturally closely associated with the water, which is considered the most important of the primal elements and in which the dead souls and ancestral beings dwell. The crocodile therefore represents an earthly link to the second world of the spirits, with which people constantly try to interact. \r\nThe ladle was used to scoop liquids and solid food from pots and kettles, often from a big wooden bowl. This was often done on feasts, to give out soup to guests. The ladles were kept in the house of the men and were sometimes a present to guests." .
