This was mostly an individual undertaking, but an adept hunter could easily catch twenty animals per day. The exact meaning of the native term for rabbit skin and rodent skin blankets which Ten Kate recorded, coohooluh, is not known but is derived from uhu'l, the Walapai term for mice (Kroeber et.al. 1935:67-68,74-75). This specimen has wefts of tightly twisted two-ply reddish-brown vegetal fiber, possibly cedar bark. Double rows of wefts strengthen the top and bottom edge.\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)\r\n\r\n\r\nMantel van konijnenvellen, \"Koehoele\" ser. etiket; zie 362-115." .
