It is an example of modern silver production in Khuzestan by Marsh Arabs and tells the story of the transition to modernity in Iran in the early 20th century.\r\nThe design is taken from European designs which became popular in the 19th century. These types of objects, such as tea spoons and hair brushes, are part of a shift to a modern way of life adopted from European habits. It also includes symbols of the Marsh Arabs that arose during the formation of modern nation states in the Middle East.\r\nThis cup and tea spoon commemorate the introduction of the railroad, which was built in the Iranian Marsh Arab territory in Khuzestan in 1925 and across the Iraqi territory in 1920. The railroad is a significant story in global politics and also in the history of oil. These railroad lines were built mainly to send oil from major ports at Basra and Khuzestan. Basra remains the largest port for oil in the world, and in 2019, Basra signed an agreement with the Dutch company Boskalis to significantly improve the capacity of the port and oil pipelines. The cup also includes symbols to define Marsh Arab identity, such as the reed house or mashoof boats. This is interesting because these symbols were used by ethnographers to identify the Marsh Arabs as well as by the Iraqi government as part of Iraqi nationalism. \r\nThe silver works made by the Marsh Arabs are particularly unique.\r\nSilverwork is one of the most important crafts in Iranian history. Silver is mined in many places in Iran and since ancient times many parts of the world, including Europe, have traded with Iran for its silver." .
