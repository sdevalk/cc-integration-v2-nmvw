<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1485-559> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The kapkap is a disc which is made from the Tridacna shell. It has triangle-shaped incisions around the edge. On top of it there is a smaller disc made from tortoise shell, which is cut out in geometrical patterns. The tortoise shell is fixed to the Tridacna with a cord through the middle and a red bead which holds it in place.\r\nThe kapkap is worn by men as ornamentation in the hair or on the forehead and is usually a sign of high status, because the production was highly elaborate and the materials rare, therefore the kapkap was very valuable. \r\nKapkaps are produced by men, sometimes with the help of women. The gathering of the shells was exclusively the men's job." .
