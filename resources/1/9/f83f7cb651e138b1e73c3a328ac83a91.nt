De spiegel wordt ingeklemd tussen het bovendeksel en de onderbouw. De versieringen in parelmoer aan de zijkanten stellen eksters in pruimenbomen boven bamboe voor. aan de voorzijde symmetrisch geplaatste versieringen van vliegende kraanvogels in de wolken. Op de bovenkant van het deksel een rivierlandschap in parelmoer. De twee laden zijn voorzien van knoppen met hangende vlamvormige plaatjes. Voorts is de kast aan de randen versierd met koperbeslag aan de randen in de vorm van ruitvormige motieven. Voorts koperbeslag met voor het sluitwerk aan de voorzijde, voor de sluiting van het deksle en de deurtjes voor de laden.\r\n\r\nThis box was used by upper class wives in their quarters to keep thread or cloth materials. It was made of the technique of mother-of-pearl inlaid. \r\nSymbolic patterns are decorously inlaid on every side of the box; on the front side, there are cranes and clouds, the Chinese character symbol 'su', meaning longevity, and stylised swastika patterns; on the top side, a landscape with five ships, the river under moonlight, mountains, pine trees, and pavilions is depicted ; on the left and right sides, bamboo trees with magpies, even on the back side, chrysanthemum patterns are found. The box's hinges, made of copper ornaments are shaped like double diamonds. They are probably stylised symbols for clouds, or swastikas. \r\n\r\nDuring the Choson period metal ornaments were extensively applied to wooden furniture to strengthen their structure or promote their function. Rather than ordinary bronze, whitish alloy of copper with a greater amount of tin called 'white bronze' was used. Brass, copper, pig iron, and cast iron were also used.  \r\nIn terms of lacquer, It was not customary to paint furnishings with opaque red or black lacquer, except for items inlaid with mother-of-pearl. \r\n\r\nThe characteristics of Korea's woodwork and lacquerwork, it seems, were formed mainly by her peculiar housing mode. The Korean climate which shows extreme summer and winter has influenced the selection of materials and designs of wooden furniture. The rainfall during June, July and August is responsible for 50-60% of the total precipitation. This weather has influenced inhabitants to build two contrasting floor types into their homes ; warm floor type of hypocaust, called 'ondol', for the long winter months, and raised wooden floors that have empty space underneath for the humid summer months. These types of floors were the reason for the lifestyle of sitting on the floor. \r\n\r\nAdhesives and nails were used only for parts where their use was unavoidable.  \r\nA Korean art historian, Choi Sun U classifies the patterns of the mother-of-pearl inlay lacquerware of the Choson dynasty into three. Patterns on the ware produced in the 15th and 16th centuries are those inherited from Koryo such as arabesque pattern, the 'floral medallion' pattern, a pair of phoenixes, a pair of dragons, etc. In the 17th and 18th century, the middle part of the Choson dynasty, the main trend in composing the patterns changed to give rise to such drawings as plum and bamboo, birds and flowers, etc. The patterns which appeared on white porcelains found their way to mother-of-pearl designs, and naive expression became prevalent. In the 19th century, expression of nature flourished. Growing in number were realistic sketches of the landscape and the ten emblems of longevity. The trend arose all of a sudden to delineate these themes humourously." .
