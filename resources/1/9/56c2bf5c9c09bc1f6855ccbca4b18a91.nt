They control game animals and hunting luck. Also, they are concerned with fertility and growth and donate the seeds of cultivated crops. Husk Faces symbolize the introduction of horticulture to the Iroquois. Husk Face Masks were worn during the midwinter ceremony when the masked dancers performed as spirits of the harvest to inaugurate the New Year. The masks were predominately worn by men. These masks are made by women by coiling three braided cornhusks around with a whole in each centre. Two coils for the eyes and one coil for the mouth. The coils are then sewed together with husk fibers to form the face. A nose is braided and sewed to the face as well. The masks were finished by adding braided cornhusks wound around the rudimentary face one or two times. To this an outer and thicker braid with bits of cornhusk is added. This part of the mask represents the hair." .
