<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7086-14> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "A head adornment of a shaman made of rattan. The rattan strip is wrapped in fabric and decorated in a patterned arrangement with strings of glass beads. \r\nThe shaman (kerei) holds the only specialized position to which a Mentawai man can accede. His ability to “see” and to communicate with souls and spirits is the magical result of a several months long initiation ceremony. This enables him to perform his multiple tasks in ritual and healing. Specific adornments are connected with his position, and others are peculiar to his wife who upkeeps together with him various taboos that are in force during his activities and seconds him in certain ritual tasks. She is also referred to as kerei." .
