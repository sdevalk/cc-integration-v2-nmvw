Plant fibres with beads were woven or knotted into each other to make a close beaded cloth. The frame is made with white beads, the triangle pattern with red, white, black and blue beads. Both sides look the same.\r\nConsidering the length of the cuff, it was probably not tied around the upper arm but rather around the wrist. However, no certain statements can be made about that, as this kind of cuff was also worn around the upper arm. It was fixed with four or six plaited cords which go off the cloth on each shorter side and which were knotted together. These cords have been ripped off and are missing though. \r\n\r\nThis kind of beaded adornment was mostly worn by women, also in combination with other plaited armbands. \r\n\r\n\r\nMogelijk gaat het om drie stukken." .
