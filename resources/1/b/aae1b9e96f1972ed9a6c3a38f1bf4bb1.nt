<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-02-1085> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The original stele for this rubbing is in the Xian Beilin. It was painted by a monk named Feng Dian who lived during the Qing Dynasty and then inscribed on the stele. In this painting, Dharma (abbreviation of Bodhidharma) is depicted as an Indian monk with a stubbly beard, carrying a shoe with a cane on the right shoulder, holding a rosary in the left hand, and stepping on reeds to cross the river. The painter depicts the image with strong lines so as to make the figure more expressive and vivid. The skill of the inscription is also terse and forceful. \r\n\r\nThe only references to the monk Fengdian are in the local records of his hometown Yongdeng in the province of Gansu. Fengdian's birthname was Li Fu. He was born in 1651 and married at 14 years old. Just 4 years after his marriage, he left his wife, cut off his fingers and converted to Buddhism. After becoming a monk he travelled the country while helping poor people and fighting social ills. It was said that he was very good at painting the portrait of Dharma and always painted them after getting drunk. He also improvised short poems and recorded them on the paintings. The original painting was made in 1689.\r\n(Jing Tan, 2008)" .
