<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/aba768d36200eaab1cb304a47b0c66df> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This ceremonial dance ornament represents a bird (awe). Its beak, head, hull and tail are carved from a single piece of wood. The bird is largely decorated with coix seeds and abrus pips. Its eyes are also indicated by abrus pips. The parts without pips have been painted white. There are a few real feathers attached to the body, mainly on the edge of the tail and wings. On the bottom there is a hole to which a stick was attached by means of which the ornament was carried above the bearer's head. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \r\nAccording to the donor, children carried this object attached to a stick during the parade in honour of the marriage of Princess Juliana of the Netherlands.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t \r\nThe bird ornament is a replica of a clan emblem representing a totemic ancestor/animal, whose ritual significance and cultural symbolism are rooted in Marind mythology.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 28.11. 2006" .
