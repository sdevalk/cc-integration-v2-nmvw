However, in style they are clearly Piman. The most probable explanation is that Piman potters availed themselves of the opportunity to sell their wares at the Yuma railway depot to visitors and passing travelers on the Southern Pacific Railroad, as they did at other stations between Tucson and Yuma.\r\n\tPaddle-and-anvil marks are visible on the interior and exterior surface. The exterior and inside of the flaring rim are decorated with painted designs. The exterior motifs on this bowl are very similar to those on Papago baskets used to gather saguaro fruits collected by Carl Lumholtz (1912:56 AMNH â€¦.). This vessel was probably used for the fermentation and storage of saguaro wine.\r\n\r\n362-33, 34, 35, 82 through 86 Papago pottery\r\n\tPiman pottery is technologically unsophisticated compared to Pueblo ceramics but can be aesthetically attractive. Vessels were built up from wet clay coils that were shaped and smoothed over with a wooden paddle and a stone anvil. When almost dried, the outside was sanded with a stone, after which a clay slip was applied and finally finely sanded with a stone before being fired about twenty minutes in a shallow pit. Decoration was applied on the still warm vessels with gum from mesquite trees (Prosopis), using a sharpened stick. In a short additional firing the decoration turned the decoration on the Pima creamware and Papago redware a deep black. Some designs were inspired by designs from potsherds found in prehistoric Hohokam ruins in the area. Pottery making was a women's craft, and considered a menial art, with little or no associated taboos.\r\n\tThe Papagos were the better potters and they traded their wares, often filled with cactus syrup, with the Pimas, receiving grain in return. The Kohatk Papagos were the main intermediaries, and Russell has surmised that the best Pima potters were of Kohatk descent or learned the craft during extended visits. Underhill has stressed that he craft of pottery, as well as skin dressing and weaving, was only learned after women reached their middle age (Russell 1908:124-131; Underhill 1939:91; Fontana et. al. 1962:9; Hayden 1959:10). The technical aspects of Piman pottery are addressed by Russell (1908:124-128), Beals 1934:28-31; Boggs (1936:102-110), Hill (1942:531-533) and Hayden (1959; also cf. Douglas 1953).\r\nHovens 2009\r\n\r\n\r\nAarden pot, beschilderd met rood-bruine versiering. Oorspronkelijk opgegeven als Yuma, maar volgens Mrs. W. Kaemlein, Arizona State Museum, okt. 1964, afkomstig uit de Pima-Papago-Maricopa groep." .
