It was also used as an element of element of trade, a fact that was later mobilised by European colonialism who made it into money (‘savage money’ for ‘forest diplomacy’ for the early Jesuits) with British court using it to fine indigenous. Perry argues that amongst the Wampanoag, it could record important treaties between Nations, relate to ceremony and history, be gambled, and given as honoring gifts. Wampanoag unlike the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Confederacy) were not as likely to associate wampum with a declaration of war.\r\n \r\nThe creation of wampum relates to Dutch colonial presence in north eastern North America in the early 17th century. In summer 2013 two groups of people made a canoe journey from Onondaga Lake in upstate New York, down the Mohawk and Hudson Rivers to the United Nations building in New York City. As argued by Ruth Phillips, their purpose was to commemorate and renew a historic agreement made 400 years earlier between Dutch settlers and Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois.  The 2013 \"Honor the Two Row\" voyage was a reenactment of its metaphoric meaning: the two parallel purple bands on a white ground represent a commitment to coexist independently and peacefully, like two canoes travelling down the same river. This records that in the seventeenth century wampum beads, as elements valued for their spiritual and aesthetic qualities which when woven could create symbolic imagery, were co-opted by military, civil and religious European authorities as a means of developing diplomacy in North America. Belts made and exchanged historically can be understood to renew political alliances but equally remind indigenous communities of dishonoured historic agreements that they represent,  when they were originally presented as legal and binding." .
