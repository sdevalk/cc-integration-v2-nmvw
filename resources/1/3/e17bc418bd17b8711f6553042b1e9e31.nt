Ebru-art is a traditional Ottoman art of creating colourful patterns by sprinkling and brushing colour pigments on a pan of oily water and then transforming this pattern to paper. This art is still popular in modern day Turkey. Ebru Durmaz (named after this art) wanted to further develop this art form in the contemporary context by transferring Ebru-art onto new material that could be used for different purposes, hence breaking with the traditional line of Ebru-art. Traditional Ebru artists argue that Ebru-art should be used in the religious and spiritual sphere, for example to combine it with Islamic calligraphy or to marble a cover of Islamic manuscripts, hence they are critical of transforming this technique of marbling onto different materials and for other purposes than religion. Durmaz focused on including Ebru-art into fashion and successfully applied the technique of marbling onto textile and established her own designer label Ebruze.\r\n\r\nIn 2015 Durmaz started a collaboration project with the Amsterdam based company House of Iznik, which is a representative office of Iznik Tiles and Ceramics (Istanbul) and the Iznik Foundation (Iznik) in Turkey. The aim was to transfer Ebru-art onto Iznik titles. The pottery industry in the city of Iznik started already in the 15th century. The Iznik style was initially strongly influenced by China and Central Asia, which was especially visible in early Iznik work due to the clear blue and white colours and specific floral designs. However, in the second half of the 16th century the pottery industry in Iznik started experimenting with different motives and colours as red, green and purple. Many of the famous Ottoman mosques, as the SÃ¼leymaniye Mosque and Blue Mosque in Istanbul, are decorated with Iznik tiles. The Iznik tiles were famous for their high quality of art in terms of design and colours and sustainability due to the high level of quartz. The quality of Iznik decreased significantly in the 17th century, because of high production costs and fierce competition with the import of Chinese porcelain. The Iznik Foundation aims to revive this art by using traditional techniques while at the same time employing contemporary technologies. Ebru Durmaz conducted research in their research centre and atelier in Iznik to successfully transfer the art of Ebru onto Iznik tiles. In 2016, the cooperation led to the production of a series of Iznik tiles that combine the Iznik style with Ebru art. The floral motives on the Iznik tile are a reproduction of a motive that is already visible on tiles in 1540s. Hence it is a reproduction of Iznik in a contemporary style, by using different colours and combining it with Ebru-art." .
