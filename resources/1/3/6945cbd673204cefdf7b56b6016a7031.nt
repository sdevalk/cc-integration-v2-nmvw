Wagilak association. \r\nGudthaykudthay paints a fract of countryside called Gubyungmirringa, which is flat eucalyptus forested land nearly forty miles east if Ramingining and about ten miles inland from Hutchinson Strait, between Howard Island and the mainland. Here, the original Badurru (hollow log) ceremony was performed. Two beings in the form of native cats attacked the their husband, who assumed the form of a glider possum after being burnt in the domestic dispute. Gathering this tribesmen, he came back and speared them to death. Their spirits left their bodies and took the form of fresh water fish in a nearby stream. However they were caught in a fish trap mand eaten by their husband's tribesmen. Their brother, the Crow man Wak, gathered their bones and put them in a hollow log and performed tthe Badurru ceremony so that their souls could find peace. Early the next morning, at the climax of the ceremony  the crow and his tribesmen took the coffin up into the sky where the bones dropped out and scattered across the heavens forming the Milky Way. The black void beside the Milky Way is where the log entered the heavens Gudthaykudthay is called 'Pussy Cat' after the native cats in this drama. This ceremony is performed as a post-death ritual by present day Yolngu (Aborigines) to finally put their deceased souls to rest. After death the body is left to decompose, and then some time later the bones are collected, cleaned, painted and placed inside a specially cut and decorated hollow log called Badurru amidst singing and dancing. The log is then brought out into the main camp and placed upright before final songs and dances are performed. It is then left. All these beings are sung, the native cats, the possum, the fish, the crow, fresh water and the hollow log. The hollow log itself is thought to be a spiritual entity in its own right. The circle painted is a hole cut near the top which represents its eye. This spirit not only resides in the sky, but is also embedded in the earth at this place.\r\n\r\nRAMINGINING\r\nRamingining is a small community of around 590 people, of whom about 30 are non-Aboriginal people, mostly advisors or teacherrs of some sort or another. The village itself is located some 400 kms to the east of Darwin, and nearly 30 kms from the Arafura Sea. It is a relatively new settlement, having only been established in the early 1970's. \r\nRamingining is situated upon the richest bauxite deposit (outside Nhulunboy) in Australia, possibly the world. The missionaries realised this and deliberately established the community at the present site to thwart mining company develeopment and associated problems as present in Nhulunboy.\r\n\r\nEarlier, in the 1960's an outstation of Milingimbi was set up at Nangalalala [ 8 kms N/E of Ramingining], a kilometre or so from the Glyde River. Ther older settlement Milingimbi Mission, was established in 1926 and is in fact situated on an island a few kilometres off the north Australia coastline. Nangala is still in existence, and is now considered an outstation of Ramingining.\r\nThe area around Ramingining on the mainland is home for the Djinang speaking Wurrkigenydjarr/Marrangu, Wulaki, Mildjingi, Balmbi and Murrungun clans.  In a wider circle are the Burarra, Rembarrnga, Wudamin, Ganalbingu and Manharrngu peoples. To the north are the Gorryindi, Gamalangga, Malarra and Walamangu peoples who look after the Crocodile Islands. Other people who live there and have ceremonial connections are members of the Gupapuyngu, Djambarrpuyngu, Wagilag, Liyagalawumir and Liya-gawumirr groups.  \r\nThe particular tract of land upon which Ramingining township is built is owned by the Djadawitjibi people, of the Djiang group. Their principal creative being is Garrtjambal, the kangaroo.\r\nSome 10-20 kms to the south of the village of Ramingining, where the looping Glyde River becomes the Goyder, is the large Arafura Swamp. Some 250 sq kms in area, this unique fresh water environment is home for an innumerable variety of water birds (including gurramatji, the magpie goose), fresh water plants, fields of water lilies, crocodiles, water snakes, insect life, and the magnificent and rare Corypha elata palm. (hundred year palm?).\r\nRamingining is situated upon the richest bauxite deposit (outside Nhuunboy) in Australia, possibly the world. The missionaries realised this and deliberately established the community at the present site to thwart mining company development and associated problems as present in Nhulunboy.\r\n\r\nThe Art\r\nThe art of Ramingining has always been highly prized and is still today pursued by some of the best known living artists in Arnhemland Land. However until the 70's, when the settlement of Ramingining was established, most of the art work of this area was circulated to the outside world either through the Art Centre at Milingimbi, or the Government settlement of Maningrida, some 80 kms to the west towards Darwin.\r\nNow the Art Centre at Ramingining has come into its own; somewhat ironically, it now services the older settlement at Milingimbi. The result of this change in the last decade is that now all art is chanelled beyond the region of its production through the Ramingining community's own Art Co-operative, Bulabula Arts.\r\nThis is a locally owned and controlled artists co-operative whose role is to 'market' the work of local painters, weavers, and sculptors to the outside world. The responsibility of the Centre is to show the works with the status and respect they deserve, and to show other people Aboriginal culture, in a way that may educate them.\r\n\r\nOrigins\r\nEvery Aboriginal person comes from a creator being, known as wangarr, in this region. These spiritual beings took many forms, moving across the land and sea, forming and shaping the landscape.\r\nAs these beings travelled they imparted the 'life force' in that place for the Aboriginal people who were affiliated to that 'country' or land tract. They gave the people their langauages, songs, ceremonies, law, social customs, and technology. Always they wore the proper body ornaments and carried with them the life-giving rranga, sacred images of the wangarr, and girri, the wordly posessions each person needed for survival. They also gave each person/group their land." .
