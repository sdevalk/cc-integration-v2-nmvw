<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-1485-326> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This wooden figure probably represents an ancestor or relative that recently died. It is carved from one piece of wood. Like all carving work, this was a man's job. \r\nIt shows a male person with a big head. The hair is tied up in the traditional way and stands up. The arms are close to the side of the body. The person is wearing a belt plus arm and ankle plaits. A much smaller human figure adorns the neck just like the neck ornaments worn for war. The carvings on the figure are black and white, the rest is coloured red.\r\nThe whole figure rests on a rectangular stud with which it could be stuck onto a roof beam. \r\nThe meaning of these figures is not quite clear apart from that they were always set up in men's houses. One can therefore assume that they represent deceased relatives or clan members. It is set up as a memory of the deceased rather than a resting place for its soul." .
