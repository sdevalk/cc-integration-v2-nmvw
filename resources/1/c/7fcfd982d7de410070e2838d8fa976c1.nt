Marutunia-tribe, Fortescue-river.\r\n\r\nEvery illness is ascribed to the djuno 2), or Evil-spirit, also know by the names of warruga or warrunga.\r\n\r\nWhen a member of the tribe falls ill, the boonangharries [Zie No's: 1207-14, 1321-47, 1321-48 en 1321-50] are set in motion 3), and the taketa  dressed up in feather ornaments [Zie 1321-19] and painted with white and red stripes, walks and struts round the sick person in huge circles, which get smaller and smaller until he is close to the prostrate patient, when he suddenly pounces upon him, rubbing vigorously the affected part with his hands, or a cowry-shell, Cypraea Scottii, [ Zie 1207-59].\r\n\r\nThen putting his mouth on the seat of pain, he pretends to pull out with his teeth the cause of the illness, generally one or two semitransparent pebbles, the size of a pidgeon's or hen's egg. which be carefully carries from the camp and buries in the sand.\r\n\r\nShould a native die, the relatives show their grief by striking their heads with flint stones and mihras [see No's: 1207-7,1207-9 and 1321-66), until the blood flows freely. They prostrate themselves upon the body screaming and howling, then walking a few yards throw themselves again and again upon the ground, giving vent to their feelings by groans and shrieks. The boonangharrie's [see No's: 1207-14, 1207-16, 1321-47 and 1321-48] are swung to drive the djuno away, as he is the cause of death. They do not believe in death by natural causes." .
