It is carved from one piece of wood. Like all carving work, this was a man's job. \r\nIt shows a male person with big legs and feet.  The man wears a hat from which the hair sticks out on the top. There is a v-shaped decoration on the chest and plaits around the ankles and arms.  \r\nThe whole figure rests on a rectangular stud with which it could be stuck onto a roof beam. \r\nThe meaning of these figures is not quite clear apart from that they were always set up in men's houses. One can therefore assume that they represent deceased relatives or clan members. It is set up as a memory of the deceased rather than a resting place for its soul." .
