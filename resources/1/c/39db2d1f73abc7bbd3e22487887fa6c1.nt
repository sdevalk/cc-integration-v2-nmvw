Hij was niet op tijd af toen zij naar de VS terugkeerde.\r\n\r\nDorothy Trujillo was born in 1932 Jemez as Dorothy Loretto, and went to live in Cochiti Pueblo after marrying Onofre Trujillo. Her husband was a jeweller. Dorothy learned the art of potterymaking during her childhood at Jemez, especially during the summers when she was not attending San Diego Mission School in California. Her tutors were her mother Carrie Reid and grandmother Lupe Madalena Loreto who both came from Laguna Pueblo. At an early age she made small pottery figures of mothers with babies, Indians in canoes, and portrait busts of Indian chiefs.\r\n \r\nDorothy married Onofre Trujillo of Cochiti who was a jeweller, and went to live with her husband's relatives. There she asked and received official permission f the govenor to learn making pottery in the Cochiti style (MSK 47). Onofre Trujilloâ€™s aunt Damacia Cordero became her tutor. Her earliest known storyteller dates from before 1970, and she makes them with varying numbers of babies and children, sometimes up as much as 125 (Cante 52). Some of her storytellers are quite large, up to 10 inches. She also began making nativity groups, and made a very large group for St. Bonaventure Church. Her origin from Jemez still transpires in het Cochiti style ceramic work, such as  a darker buff or light tan slip (90). Her work is usually bold and crisp;   characteristic is an incised T-shape in the storyteller's hair, indicating the parting. and not a trademark as has been assumed (104-5). Because of the commercial success of his wife's work, Onofre gave up making jewelry and assisted his wife in the many tasks involved in potterymaking. He also produced small bears with tos in their paws (MSK 47,56). She has work in collections at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, and the Heard Museum in Phoenix, AZ. (Schaaf 2002:312). Dorothy Trujillo taught her two daughters the art of pottery, continuing the cherished tradition. She died in 1999.\r\n \r\nMargot Spiegel-Kramer befriended Dorothy Trujillo on het first visit to Cochiti in 197? and returned frequently afterwards. Dorothy showed het Dutch friend how she made storytellers, teaching her the finer points of firing Indian style. Both potters also exchanged lumps of clay and Dorohy was quite pleased how her bowls made from kaolin clay turned out (Spiegel-Kramer z.j.:44-48,56)." .
