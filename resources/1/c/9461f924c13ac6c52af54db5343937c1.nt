Schmeltz 1903; beschrijvingskaart)\r\n\r\nHouten knots (whackaberry) met een effen greep, gescheiden van de knots door een diepe insnijding, terwijl verder de gehele oppervlakte met dicht aaneenliggende fijne overlangse groeven bedekt is en het geheel met rode kleurstof is ingesmeerd.\r\n\r\nWhackaberry, club of yellowisch brown wood; like No. 1207-11, but stained red and one end acornshaped.\r\n\r\nAnother method is by placing boughs of shrubs in two semicircles around the waterhole, leaving an entrance and a narrow exit. The first few days the animals are too shy to enter the enclosure prefering to go 10 or 15 miles up or down the creek, to visit another waterhole, but after 4 or 5 days, they get used to it, and enter. When the Blacks see bu the tracks that they come again to drink there, they place early in the afternoon, a strong net made of reeds, or the fibre of Spinifex-grass acrose the exit and lie in wait.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, when several animals have entered the enclosure, they suddenly rush out, shouting and yelling and run towards the entrance of the enclosure. The animals try to escape at the exit, bur becoming entangled in the net, are easily killed with blows of the whackaberry (Taf. III. Fig. 11 & 12).\r\n\r\nThey are experts in killing hawks or other birds of prey. They tie a small bird, rat or lizzard by a string to a short stick, and holding this in one hand, they hide under a clump of a large Spinifex bush or leafy snake-wood shrub. Just before they hide, they set fire to some Spinifex in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe dense black smoke that is given off rises to a great height, attracting th birds of prey for miles around, who come from all directions in the hope of a good feed of lizzards, which holt from the burning bushes. The hawk seeing the bird or rat tied to the stick, pounces down upon it, and is easily killed with a blow of the whackaberry, by the concealed Black. In a few hours 10 to 15 hawks are thus caught, which from a welcome addition to the menu of the family-supper." .
