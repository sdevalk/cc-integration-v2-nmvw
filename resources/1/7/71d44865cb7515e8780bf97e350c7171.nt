<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-2802-95-1> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This carved piece of wood is one of the two longer side pieces of a bed frame. The whole bed is part of the collection, it has been taken apart. A mattress from plaited palm leaves goes with it. \r\nThe board is quadrangular in diameter and has two motif ends with round tips which are shaped like a canoe prow. Two human figures lie in it mirroring each other. The middle part has engravings, which are coloured white and black. The whole piece is coloured red. The human motif on the ends also has black and white painting on the red. Near the motif ends, there are two holes and slits respectively. The hole is for the bed leg to be put in. The slit holds the joint of the short side piece. The beds were hardly long enough to hold the whole body, so people had to sleep with their knees up. \r\nThe beds were used as resting place, but also had a ceremonial function. It was used for weddings where the adorned bride was carried to her husband's house on such a bed. The bed was then part of the dowry. It is not sure whether sleeping beds and ceremonial beds had different designs or special motifs. \r\nDuring the day, beds would also serve as chairs and tables. \r\n\r\n2802-95 1 t/m 11 op één kaart ; de maten van de slaapbank in z'n geheel L 187 cm, B 62, H 45 cm x? Er horen enkele ruwgevlochten palmbladeren bij als matras." .
