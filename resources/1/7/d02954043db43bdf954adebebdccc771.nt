<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-2802-123b> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This beaded cloth was tied around the lower leg as adornment. \r\nThe manufacture was the job of the women. A number of plant threads or fibres were stretched parallel to each other on a wooden board. The number of threads coincided with the desired number of beads in each row. Another long thread was used to make the cross connection. Both threads were pulled through the bead. In this warp-plaiting technique, a whole cloth with different patterns would be made. This one has rhomboid patterns in two divisions. White, black, light blue and red glass beads were used. On two sides, there are three pairs of plaited cord each, which were used to tie the cuff to the leg. Red and blue cotton strips are attached to the ends of these cords.\r\nThe leg bands were worn above the ankle and knotted in the front. Both women and men would wear these in combination with other adornment like plaited arm- and leg bands.\r\nThe long side is damaged and a few cords are torn off.\r\n\r\n\r\n2802-123a en 2802-123b op één kaart ; een stel" .
