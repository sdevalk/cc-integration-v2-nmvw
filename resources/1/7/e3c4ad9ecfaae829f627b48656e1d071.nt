The haus tambaran (Tok Pisin) [OR korombo (Abelam/Abulas) OR menâ€™s house] was furnished with arrangements of images and paintings for the duration of higher phases. This leg is part of a figure representing a nggwal, an important clan ancestor.  The seated figure is 216cm high and was the central element in a large room called the gambawut. It was positioned in front of a wall covered with paintings, including RV-5526-0-36. -Erna Lilje 24-05-19" .
