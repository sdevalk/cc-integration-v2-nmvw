Kooijman, februari 1974 :\r\nPot van aardewerk (herai of ebé).\r\nDe pot is grijszwart van kleur, vervaardigd door vrouwen uit een gezuiverde, grijzwarte klei. De methode van vervaatdiging is waarschijnlijk de lappentechniek geweest voor de onderzijde (in wezen een combinatie van de drijf - en kloptechniek met de spiraraalwindingstechniek, waarbij dan, in plaats van kleislierten, plakken of \"lappen\" klei worden gebruikt). Voor de rest van de pot is de drijf- en kloptechniek toegepast. De potwand is versierd met twee kleislierten, één cirkelvormig en rondgaand en de ander zigzag-lopend.\r\n\r\nTwo french ethno-archaeologists have studied the different techniques used in New Guinea for the production of ceramics.\r\nAll the earthenware pot used to stock, prepare or serve sago are exclusively manufactured in the village of Abar. Men make only small pots for the lime \r\nThe female potters use an original technique : ceramic manufactured without bottom. They use small flat ring sections of red clay stick by the interior of the pot. Stone (see 1528-459) and wood bats (see 1528-460) are used at the end of the manufacturing to make disappear the ring traces. The sinuous ribbon decorations (the serpent sign in Abar) is stuck then. The following day they close the pot bottom. After drying during one day the pots are baked one by one for thirty minutes. The pots are the exchanged by the men especially with people coming from Ormu-Wari who give them axe and people from Genyem basin.\r\n\r\nThe authors supposed that this technique (ceramic manufactured without bottom) could come from the Molucca.To support this idea the authors add that only people from Lake Sentani and Vanimo use wood forks to eat sago in New Guinea, like people from Moluccas do.\r\n\r\nTo maintain the pot a support for pot in rattan is used (see 3600-7645). The support for pot is made of strong strips of rattan twisted out.\r\nIt was lashed transversally with the end of the strips at a single pot \r\nIt was intended to be placed under globe-shaped pots to prevent their fall. It is manufactured by men. As the ordinary pots are all of the same size, the rings which come from Tobati are of the same width as those met with on Lake Sentani. The height is such that the pot is supported all around and the bottom remains free from the floor. Those which come from private houses, appear to be the property of the women, at least at Asei the persons, who wanted to deal with Sande in these articles, mowda, were women. These support are only plaited in Asei. Each village of Lake Sentani is specialize in on specific production. The exchanges between them compensate for the unequal wealths sharing out \r\nIn Tobati it is called muda (mura) or medjua. The exchanges between them compensate for the unequal wealths.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the dishes took place in the houses and was the duty of the women." .
