There are seven figures in all, three female and four male. Since at least two barong landung groups are present, the gathering perhaps took place during a temple festival or a Galungan visit. The audience is predominantly children, some carrying banners and processional paraphernalia.  Perhaps a drama is taking place, although the children seem to be more interested in the photographer. It is not known where the photograph was taken. \r\nThe donor, Augusta de Wit (1864-1939), is an important Indies writer of both fiction and travel, especially of Java. She visited Bali from October to late December 1911, writing about it in a series of letters in the Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant, later worked into her book \"Natuur en menschen in Indië\" (Nature and people in [Netherlands] India) (1914). During her travels in Bali and elsewhere she made an extensive collection of photographs, both by herself and by others, including a German architect called Curt Gründler who lived in Bali around 1910.  Photographs by Gründler are published in De Wit's book. The photograph of the barong landung was probably made either by De Wit herself or by Gründler, and probably dates from 1910 or 1911. \r\nFrancine Brinkgreve" .
