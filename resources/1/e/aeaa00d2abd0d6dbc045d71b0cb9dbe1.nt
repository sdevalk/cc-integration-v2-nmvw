The long stick is unpainted and has a carved incision; the shorter ones are painted black. Ten Kate noted that the Hopis referred to these prayer sticks as \"tsjee,\" and that this set came from a snake priest.\r\n362-163; 682-6 Prayer sticks \r\nPrayer sticks, called paahos by the Hopis, the generic term referring to \"praying for water,\" come in a great variety of shapes and sizes, depending on their specific use and maker. The making of some types is restricted to members of specific societies; some types are only used in certain ceremonies or for special purposes. Each type is distinct in material, composition, color, design and name, made according to prescribed rules, set out by the chief kachinas. They are offerings to the kachinas, prayers requesting general or specific benefits for the people. Most prayer sticks have a turkey feather, but adding a bundle of turkey feathers makes it a prayer for game. Adding a duck feather turns the stick into a prayer for rain; an owl feather added means a prayer for warm weather to assure a good harvest of peaches. Grass stems added to a stick turn it into a prayer for abundant grass cover that attracts deer and antelope. If a youth wishes to pray for physical strength and endurance he adds the feather of a hummingbird to the stick. The Sun sees the new prayer sticks every day and absorbs the essence of their prayers, and carries this to the underworld where they are received by Müíyiñwûüh who knows all types, and distributes them to the appropriate chief kachinas. These kachinas take the feathers from the sticks and decorate their foreheads with them, while sending the wished for blessings to the people (Stephen 1936:1269-1270).\r\nAbout these prayer sticks, Ten Kate noted: \"Heading across the surface of the mesa, which extends along the side of Moshóngavé, Oyiwísha directed my attention to a couple of small sticks dyed green, ornamented with downy feathers, which were planted in the ground. They were offerings of a priest from the Order of the Serpent and marked the spot where he had prayed for rain. Oyiwísha was later able to provide me a couple of these gems in the envelope of corn husks and sacred flour in which they were wrapped before making the offering. They closely resembled those I later obtained from the [Zuni] priests of the Order of the Bow\" (see: Zuni chapter; cf. Voth 1901: plate 41).\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrie gevederde bidstokken, twee gele en een zwarte, van de Rattle-snake medicijn-orde." .
