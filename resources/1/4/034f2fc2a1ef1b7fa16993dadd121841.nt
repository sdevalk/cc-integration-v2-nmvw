<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/bde7c1940507913a80c01be7e3fdcbbe> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This ceremonial dance ornament represents a bird (dawe-dawi), possibly a plover.  It is carved from wood. The bird has a very long beak, spread wings and a flat tail. The top is largely decorated with coix seeds and abrus pips.  The eyes are also indicated by abrus pips. The parts without pips have been painted yellow. There are a few real feathers attached to the body, mainly on the sides and wings. On the flat bottom there is a hole to which a stick was attached by means of which the ornament was carried above the bearer's head. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \r\nAccording to the donor, children carried this object attached to a stick during the parade in honour of the marriage of Princess Juliana of the Netherlands.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\nThe bird ornament is a replica of a clan emblem representing a totemic ancestor/animal, whose ritual significance and cultural symbolism are rooted in Marind mythology.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          \r\nDawe-dawi is a beach bird and there is possible association with Dawena, the mother of Yorma (sea dema, Wirz, P., 1922-25, IV, Plate 36, Fig. 1., Wirz, P., 1922-25, III, Plate 4. and Wirz, P., 1928, p. 97, Fig. 31.). She is the dema who brought the ground water; she \"produces all the sub-level flows which feed the lowest spots and swamps. ... When there is a long and severe drought, coconut-leaves are planted in a pit and Dawena is called upon with the formula 'Dawena, Dawena! urinate in this place' \" (Van Baal, 1966: 382).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n IVANA HLADKA, 20.11. 2006" .
