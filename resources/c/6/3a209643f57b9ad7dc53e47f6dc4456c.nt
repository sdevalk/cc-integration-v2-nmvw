<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-295-39> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Rather unusual example of a 'transitional' form between a fighting club and a boomerang. Such examples are usually thicker and heavier. Likely to be from the central Murray River region. Sikkelvormige boemerang, met scherpe hoek. Het hele object is gezwart met enkel de top die bruin gelaten is. De handgreep is ronder en heeft inkepinkjes, waardoor de handgreep enigszins ruw is. Er zijn een aantal krasjes op de platte zijde van de boemerang.\r\nUnusually large and slim boomerang-club, south-eastern Australia, probably N.S.W.\r\n(Bron: beschrijvingskaart, d.d. januari 1963; paraaf: Dr. S. Kooijman)\r\n\r\nDe handgreep is onderaan ingekerfd zoals op knotsen 295-54 en 295-55.\r\n\r\nBoomerangs serve numerous functions.  Boomerangs are used as a knife, a hammer or club, a digging tool, for making fire by friction, for musical accompaniment as a percussion instrument as well as their main function as a hunting or fighting weapon. It is important to note that most fighting and hunting boomerangs were non-returning.  They were thrown to hit their targets and not return. Boomerangs are also used in games and competitions.  Furthermore, they have ceremonial uses, serving as objects of social and religious significance.  They are also produced for commercial reasons and are popular trade items." .
