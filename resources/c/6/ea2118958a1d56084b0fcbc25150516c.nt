<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-2385-34> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This ceremonial dance ornament represents a fish (yamara / ikan kuru). It is carved from wood.   The top is largely decorated with red, black and white coix seeds and abrus pips. The eyes of the fish are also indicated by abrus pips. The parts without pips have been painted yellow. There are a few real feathers attached to the body, mainly on the head, fins and tail. On the bottom there is a hole to which a stick was attached by means of which the ornament was carried above the bearer's head. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \r\nAccording to the donor, children carried this object attached to a stick during the parade in honour of the marriage of Princess Juliana of the Netherlands. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThis fish figure is an emblem of the Bragai-ze-ha clan of the Bragai-ze phratry representing a totemic ancestor/animal, whose ritual significance and cultural symbolism are rooted in Marind mythology.\t\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 28.11. 2006" .
