He carries a net bag over his shoulder in which he keeps his personal belongings. Above his elbow he carries a series of precious shell armlets. He has stuck a comb decorated with feathers in his hair. Most precious of all is the ornament he carries on his back (gumbale), made of twine decoated with little pieces of shell. It is an important status symbol, and it represents the face of an ancestor decorated with boars' tusks." .
