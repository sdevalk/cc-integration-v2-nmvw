It is carved from wood and largely decorated with coix seeds and abrus pips. The eyes of the fish are indicated by abrus pips. There are several real feathers attached to the body, mainly on the sides and at the tail. On the bottom there is a hole to which a bamboo stick was attached by means of which the fish ornament was carried above the bearer's head.\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\nAccording to the donor, children carried this object attached to a stick during the parade in honour of the marriage of Princess Juliana of the Netherlands. \t\t\t\t\t\t             \t\t\t\t  \r\nThis tuna fish figure is an emblem of the Diwa-rek clan of the Mahu-ze phratry representing a totemic ancestor/animal, whose ritual significance and cultural symbolism are rooted in Marind mythology.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  One myth narrates about the Diwa-canoe (Diwa is also the name of dema Yugil) in which three dema sailed from Yavar-makan, mayo area, to Senayo to attend a big feast celebrating the marriage between Harau and Elme. During their return from the feast a big sea-snake, \"Salendo approached the canoe and stirred up a strong eddy. The canoe, which slowly followed Salendo down the river, had to be relieved of its load and successively a sago-powder, an old woman (who changed into a tortoise), a couple of fishes (hara and karambu, [the latter is a member of the puntius family]) and a big load of sago were thrown out. â€¦ Then, at Sirapu, a little distance upstream from Merauke, on the opposite bank, Salendo reappeared and assailed the canoe, which turned upside down\" (ibid.: 312). The dema were left at Sirapu where they live till today. Salendo swam to Anassai where he has remained in a swamp, called Mayo, up to the present day.\r\n\r\nIn ritual myth re-enactment this episode is symbolically represented by means of three wooden human figures inside a boat. This ceremonial, ornamented and painted object is carried on the heads of two decorated men. A few other costumed men follow the boat. One of them wears a head ornament representing a fish, karambu, which according to legend followed the Diwa-canoe. The second one wears on his head a figure of salendo, with the teeth of a wild pig (see also n. 2008-21).\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 28.11. 2006" .
