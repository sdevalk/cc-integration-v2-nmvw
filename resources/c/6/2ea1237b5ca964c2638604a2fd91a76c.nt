Krijnen\".\r\nMet kurk, verbroken zegel en ingedroogde verf op bodem. Voorzien van buik- en prijsetiket, zonder halsetiket.\r\n\r\nOriginally part of a box with batik paraphernalia (dyes, brushes and two \"canting\") from the period of colonial batik hobby craze in Indonesia. What immediately stands out when looking at the bottles with dyes is that the names of the colours of the dyes are written in Dutch. Also interesting is the rather large quantity of dyes; more colours than is customary in traditional Javanese batik. Because of these two points this box was presumably intended for the colonial (Indo)-European market: for an artist or crafts(wo)man or hobbyist.\r\n \r\nAround 1900 there were many artists in the Netherlands who experimented with batik as a decoration technique within the Nieuwe Kunst-movement, such as Adri Pieck, Bertha Bake, Carel Adolph Lion Cachet, Theo Neuhuys, Theo Molkenboer, Chris Lebeau, Johan Thorn Pricker and Louis Bogtman. Batik became very popular: batik methods were published in women's magazines, books were published on how to batik and batik demonstrations were held in different warehouses in the Netherlands such as De Bijenkorf in Amsterdam and Grand Bazar de la Paix in The Hague. In adverts in newspapers special patented dyes (f.i. “Malax”) were promoted. Batik was used to decorate all kinds of objects from bookcovers and tea cosies to lampshades.\r\n\r\nIn Indonesia textiles and textile trade already played a huge role in Indonesian society with its trade network in South-East Asia, before the Dutch presence in the archipelago. From the middle of the 19th century, next to traditional Indonesian factories, Indo-European batik factories sprung up like mushrooms. Like the existing indigenous batik factories, these companies developed their own genre and specialty. Women played a very big part in the Indo-European batik industry. Carolina Josephina von Franquemont developed the so called Batik Belanda with kains with different colours, decorations and sizes compared to the tradititional Indonesian batiks. There were also batik factories that were owned by Peranakan Chinese and so called \"Arabieren\" with their own specific patterns.\r\n\r\nThe craze of batik as a hobby for women also took place in colonial (Indo-) European society in Indonesia. In a newspaper article in \"De Locomotief\" from 1919, Quirien A.A. Krijnen who, together with his wife Nellie Surie, ran an atelier called \"Emulation\" in Weltevreden (a quarter in Jakarta) organised travelling exhibitions to show and demonstrate his method of batik using special easy to rinse out dyes he named \"batikol\". With the use of pierced patterns on paper and his special dyes applied with Chinese brushes, women and ‘eenige heeren’(‘iedere middelmatige beoefenaar’) could practice their batik hobby with ease in their own homes. The objects shown in the exhibitions varied from tea cosies, calendres and pillowcovers to tablecloths. In the newspaper article the great amount of available  dyes (16) is also  mentioned, just as the different delicate fabrics that could be used for batik with the \"Methode Krijnen\", such as Javanese silk. According to the newspaper article Javanese visitors of the exhibitions were also very interested in this new method of batik, because the traditional Javanese method was very time consuming." .
