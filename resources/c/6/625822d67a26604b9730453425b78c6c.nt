In a first step, the bottom is plaited in a square shape. Then the bag is plaited upwards in the shape of a hose. Some of the leaves are plaited in to cords, which are knotted to serve as strap. \r\nThis bag is particularly used for drying the sago flour. After is has been washed out and cleaned, it is put in such bags, which are hung on a beam to dry. The water drips out and leaves the flour in the shape of the bag. The chunk of sago is then wrapped in a whole palm leaf to be stored or sold on the market. \r\nThe bags always have the same size, because they are used as measurement device for sago." .
