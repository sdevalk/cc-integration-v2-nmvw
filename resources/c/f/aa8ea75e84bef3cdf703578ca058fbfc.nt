The pottery produced in the nineteenth century was indistinctive and included black- and redwares, as well as micaceous vessels. The polychrome containers used during ceremonial occasions came from San Ildefonso.\r\n\r\nA new era for pottery production began when the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad connected neighbouring Espanola to Santa Fe in 1880. Soon Santa Clara craftswomen were turning out black tableware, including coffee and teapots and cups, cream pitchers and sugar bowls, and vases, all with handles, an uncommon feature on tradional pottery. Hispanic and American households probably were the main clients for such wares if fired at a high temperature. For the tourist market candlesticks, ashtrays and miniature animals and mocassins were produced, as well as tableware fired at a low temperature and apt to disintegrate rapidly when in use (Hayes and Blom 1996:130).\r\n\r\nDuring the 1930s redwares made a comeback and were decorated first with geometric, later also with naturalistic motifs, executed in cream, shades of orange and blue gray, often outlined in white.\r\n\r\nThe pueblo has long been known for its innovative pottery. The carving of designs into the wet clay was developed at an early date at Santa Clara, resulting in carved red- and black-wares with thick walls. Margaret Tafoya (b. 1904) has been a leading potter over many decades, inspiring new generations, and was bestowed the honorary title of \"matriarch of Santa Clara potters\". In the post-war era she still produced very large vessels, contrary to the trend towards size reduction. She produced a dynasty of pot¬ters among children and grand¬children, including the Roller (Toni et.al.) and Youngblood (Nancy, Nathan et.al.) families most of whom consistently use traditional methods of gathering and preparing clay, and firing technique (see Schaaf 2000:137 for genealogy).\r\n\r\nOther Santa Clara pottery dynasties include the Chavarria-Naranjo and Gutierrez-Baca-Tafoya families (Dil¬lingham 1994:146-239). Avanyu (rain¬bow ser¬pent) and bear¬paw designs are characteris¬tic of carved pottery from Santa Clara. Severa Tafoya (1890-1973) probably made the first mellon-shaped bowl that has now become a clas¬sic Santa Clara pot.\r\n\r\nA post-war development was the fine carving of designs, often referred to as etching, into fired pottery, a technique known as \"sgraffito\", of which Joseph Lonewolf (b. 1932) became the unchallenged mas¬ter. He is a nephew of Margaret Tafoya and his children and other young Santa Clarans follow into his foot¬steps (Dillingham 1994:184-5,205). Jody/Susan? Folwell (b. 1942) learned the pottery craft from her mother Rose Naranjo, and pioneered new colors, techniques and motifs. She uses her pictorial pottery style, including multiple designs, as a means of social and criticism, thus adding a new dimension to the art of Pueblo pottery (Schaaf 2000:26-7).\r\n\r\nA more recent innovator is Roxanne Swentzel (b. 1962), a granddaughter of Rose Naranjo. Her pottery has turned into sculpture, representing real people and clown figures, single and in groups, engaged in their own world or addressing the spectator.\r\n\r\nA major attraction at Santa Clara is the prehistoric pueblo of Puye, and the associated cliffdwellings, designated a National Historic Landmark. During the summer season, guided tours are available, and the Puye Cafe and Gift Shop, also offering Santa Clara pottery, is open on weekdays. Public celebrations are held on the feast days of Saint Anthony in June and Saint Clare in August, and include Comanche, Harvest and Corn dances." .
