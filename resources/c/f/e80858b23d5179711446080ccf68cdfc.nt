Boys can begin wearing them from around four to six years old, without undergoing any particular ceremony. Variety in the sizes and shapes of penis-sheaths reflect group affiliation and the personal preferences of wearers and are not linked to expressions of sexuality or social rank, contrary to the perception of many outsiders.\r\n\r\nSince the 1950s, missionaries and administrators have campaigned for them to be replaced by shorts. This was done in the name of modernisation, and motivated by missionaries’ concerns about the moral implications of what they perceived as near-nudity.\r\n\r\nMissionaries set in motion new trajectories for gender roles, relations and identities. They particularly tried to influence male activities by discouraging things, such as polygamy, as well as providing new opportunities, such as school education and religious careers.\r\n\r\nPenis-sheaths symbolised the primitiveness of highland Papuans, for the Indonesian administration, which launched of an army-led ‘development program’, named Operasi Koteka, in 1971. The supposed benefits of which were overshadowed by the attempt to force people to wear ‘decent clothing’. It was unsuccessful as most preferred their normal attire.\r\n\r\nToday penis-sheaths continue to be worn as are western clothing options, the choice often depends upon the context.  Last year, several university students in the Papuan capital, Jayapura, caused controversy by wearing traditional clothes, including penis-sheaths, to class. They said it was matter of showing cultural pride, no different than when their friends wear batik clothes. -Erna Lilje\r\n\r\nMunro, Jenny (2017) “2.
