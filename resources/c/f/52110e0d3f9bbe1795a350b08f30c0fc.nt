Was als ruilmiddel van groot belang. In flesje bewaard. \r\n\r\nWilgie, red pigment, for painting face and body: in pieces, unprepared. A great artickle of barter.\r\n\r\nA corrobboree is held in the evening, and men and women are grotesquely painted with \"butungu\" or yellow ochre like No. 1207-99, \"wilgie' or red ochre and \"ginda\" or charcoal. Monotonous chants are sung, each line beginning with a high note, falling in semi-tones rapidly to a low one; kailis (boomerangs) are rattled together, and a Kangaroo-bone is moved rapidly up and down on the lateral incisions of the mihra or throwing-stick 1).\r\n\r\nOne such occasions everything that is required for the hunting and killing of Kangaroos is largely in evidence and spears and mihras, whackaberries and stone-knives and -axes are freely displayed.\r\n\r\nIn a month's time, (the next new-moon) the whole tribe has assembled, and on a given signal by one of the elders, the candidates for circumcision are suddenly pounced upon by the men, their arms are tied firmly to the body by human hair strings, whilst the \"boonangharries\" of \"Devil-scarers\" [see No's: 1207-14, 1321-47 and 1321-48] are violently swung in the camp, to keep the \"djuno\", or Evil-spirit away.\r\n\r\nThe boys are painted all over with \"wilgie\" or red-ochre, and are then fed by the old women with various grass-seeds, pounded and ground to a pulp on the \"mijarra\", and moistened with water (baba), or baked in little cakes in the hot ashes. Meat is not allowed them on this occasion.\r\n\r\nAt night, huge fires are kindled, and the elders sit around them with the candidates, teaching them the laws and traditions of the tribes, the boundaries of their territory, the reasons of their feuds with other tribes etc., etc., and the strict lines of their future conduct are clearly laid down for them.\r\n\r\nRitual songs and dances are taught and performed, their significance explained and the mystery of the \"tarlow\"and its ceremonial expounded.\r\n\r\nThe \"una\" or hunting dance of the men, and the dance of the old women, the \"tubagéh\", are danced every night around the camp-fire, accompanied by the rattling of spears and kailis [see No's: 1207-46 and 1321-44], and the incessant roaring of the boonangharries [see No's 1207-14, 1321-47 and 1321-48] and the monotonous songs of the old men.\r\n\r\nThe \"nambéh\", or circumcision-song is taught to them, so that they may sing it on the day of the actual ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe \"una\"dance is one of the most weird spectacles imaginable.\r\nSome 30 or 40 men (more in larger tribes), feather ornaments on head and upper arms, a wurrindi, or bunch of Emu-feathers [see No's: 1321-18 and 1321-19], coloured with wilgie hanging behind, from a hair-belt tied around the waist, a muljeddie of wood [see No: 1207-73] or Kangaroo-bone [see No. 1321-27], trough the septum of the nose, and painted with white and red stripes across the face, chest, abdomen and thighs, suddenly spring with a yell from the outer darkness into the bright fire circle.\r\n\r\nA short strong spear (about 6 feet long) in each hand, held perpendicularly, the shaft touching the ground, the body bent forward, eyes rolling and teeth glistening, they stamp with feet and spear shafts on the ground, keeping time to the songs of the old men, who click their kailis [see No's\"1207-46 and 1207-44] together and rattle their mihras [see No's: 1207-7, 1207-9 and 1321-66].\r\n\r\nAfter a weeks or tendays feeding and dancing, the boys, who during that time were not allowed to see a young woman or child of either sex, nor to go unaccompanied by men into the bush, are taken away from the camp, to a place prepared for the actual operation.\r\n\r\nThis place is a circular space cleared of shrubs, grass and stones, having in the centre a large couch of branches, grass and leaves. The men painted in full war-paint with wilgie and gilba, their hair tied back from the forehead with hair strings, suddenly seize the youths, throw them down on the couch, and perform the operation with a Stone-knife called \"borulla\" or \"cundemarra\". The fathers never operating upon their own sons.\r\n\r\nWhilst this is going on, the women set up a frightful howl in their camp, which they are not allowed to leave." .
