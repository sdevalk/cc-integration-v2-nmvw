Marcel Griaule's book, Masques dogons (1938), contains lengthy descriptions of the masks, including their myths of origins, their function in society, the techniques for making them, and the music, songs, dances, and costumes associated with them.  Masques dogons, one of the earliest anthropological studies of African art, remains one of the most thorough and complete.\r\nDogon myth attributes the origin of masks to beings called Andoumboulou. The first masks were made out of fiber, and although they were eventually acquired by Dogon women -and later by Dogon men- their function did not become apparent until after the appearance of death among the Dogon. The first ancestor to die did so while in the form of a snake, part of the process of transformation into a spirit that was practiced until that time. When people became aware of the negative effects of the nyama released by death, it was decided to carve a mask to serve as a support for the nyama.  This mask, in the form of a snake like the dead ancestor, was the initial at \"great mask\", or \"mother of masks,\" used in the sigi ceremony, which commemorates this mythic event every sixty years.  Although its face is in the form of a mask, the \"great mask\" is never actually worn; rather it is displayed in a stationary position or while being carried.  In each Dogon village a new \"great mask\" is made every sixty years for the celebration of sigi'.\r\nAfter the initial death that prompted the making of the \"great mask,\" other deaths followed, and measures had to be taken to cope with the nyama released.  At first, ancestor altars were erected, with wood figures serving as the repository for the spiritual forces, but as the deaths proliferated this was not sufficient.  Masks were then made for dama rituals in which the souls of the dead are permanently escorted out of the village and sent on their way to the afterlife.\r\nDogon masks are intimately bound up with rituals concerned with death.  A small group of masks -four fiber bede masks and a carved wood mask called sirige- are donned for dances held two days after the burial of men who have participated in a sigi ceremony. This part of the funerary ritual is called baga bundo.  The dancers wearing the bede, or female masks, kneel next to the funerary blanket that is displayed in the public square; they pound the earth on either side of it, a gesture that women mourners perform in other stages of the funeral. The wearer of the sirige mask also performs a similar gesture of mourning and respect, leaning down so that the tip of the mask -often fifteen feet high- will touch the ground.\r\nSeveral years after the actual funeral, the dama rite is performed. A dama requires lengthy and costly preparations, and one of its functions is to enhance the prestige and reputation of the deceased and of his descendants through these elaborate preparations.  When the necessary food has been produced and collected, new wooden masks are carved and fibers are prepared and dyed for their costumes and for fiber hood masks. The dama ritual itself lasts six days, during which time the mask society performs in the village plaza, on the terrace of the deceased's house, and in the hogon's sacred fields.  Griaule witnessed seventy-four masks at the dama held for an ordinary man in 1935; for a \"great dama\" performed for a man who held an important rank in his lineage, several hundred masked dancers may perform.  The soul of the deceased, localized in the handle of his hoe and in a container of millet beer, is removed from the village by throwing these spirit containers into the bush.  When performed for women, the dama does not include masked dancing, except in the case of the yasigine, the sole female member of the men's mask society.\r\nThe variety of Dogon masks is overwhelming.  Griaule's informants listed more than seventy-eight different types, representing mammals, reptiles, birds, humans, objects, and abstract concepts.  They are made of both carved wood and knotted fiber. The fiber masks represent primarily human characters, such as Dogon village specialists (hogon, binukedine, blacksmith, leather worker, European doctor) and their wives, or men and women of other ethnic groups, such as Bamana, Fulant, and Tuareg. The wooden masks for the most part depict animals and birds.  Together the masks may be seen as a summary of the people, animals, and things that constitute the Dogon world, a visual accounting of the return to order in the universe following the disruption caused by death." .
