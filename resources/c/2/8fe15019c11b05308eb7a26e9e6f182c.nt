It is funnel-shaped. It has as decoration an open-work rim with triangles at the top. This rim sticks out. There is an attached foot which is made in the same way as the bowl itself.\r\nBasketry-making was the job of men. \r\nThe baskets were used as a bowl for storage or short-distance transport of plant food, especially fruit. These baskets without Parinarium coat are probably left unfinished, because Europeans liked them better." .
