Dergelijke potjes worden ook gebruikt voor het bewaren van amuletten met genezende kracht.\r\n\r\nAs regards to tribal arts, Zuni is especially known for its silver jewelry, exquisitely inlaid with turquoise and other semi-precious stones creating colorful mosaic, and for the miniature animal fetish carvings in a variety of stones, and beadwork figures of people and animals in all sizes.\r\n\r\nPotterymaking has a long and rich tradition. During the second half of the seventeenth century the Zunis made polychrome glazed pottery, named Hawikuh Polychrome. It was replaced by matte Ashiwi Polychrome around 1700, using black and red paint on surfaces with a white slip. By mid-century Zuni Polychrome developed. In the first half of the nineteenth century life-forms appeared as motifs on ceramics, at first abstract, then more realistic, birds and deer occurring most frequently. Typical is the \"deer in his house\" motif: the figure of a black deer with a narrow open channel running from the mouth, through the neck into the heart, through which a red \"heartline\" runs, symbolizing the hunter's prayer to the spirit of the animal to give itself up so it can nourish the people. Feathers, plumed prayer sticks, rosettes and the mythical rain bird were other popular motifs.\r\n\r\nPottery making occurred throughout the year, but during the first four days of the summer solstice celebration all women engaged in mass production, a special occasion. Zuni pottery production continued relatively undisturbed untill 1880 when with the advent of the railroad western goods became available in large quantities and replaced household items of Native manufactures rapidly. Only tourist knick knacks were made in some quantity, including gaudily painted miniature mocassins. When trader C.G. Wallace persuaded women since 1918 to turn to making beadwork figures for tourist, it caused pottery making virtually to cease. Only a few women remained active potters, including Tsayutitsa, the best craftsperson according to Batkin (1987:165). An attempt by Catalina Zuni to boost Zuni pottery in the 1930s had litlle success.\r\n\r\nThe Zuni pottery tradition was kept alive by Daisy Hooee, a grandchild of Nampeyo of Hopi. She had studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris and married a Zuni man. At the Zuni High School she taught a pottery class, emphasizing the Zuni style. Her successor was Jennie Laate from Acoma, who also married into Zuni.\r\n\r\nIn the 1980s pottery production was revived at Zuni, and Josephine Nahohai played an important role in establishing a new family pottery tradition that now includes her sons Randy and Milford, and Randy's wife Rowena Him. Josephine Nahohai received the Katherine H. Lamont Fellowship in 1984 to study the pottery collections at the School of American Research in Santa Fe, and in 1986 visited the Smithsonian Institution, and was inspired by the prehistoric and historic vessels and their decorations. She taugh willing students at Zuni the art and craft. The high price of silver induced some Zuni artists to change from jewelry to pottery.\r\n\r\nOther contemporary potters include the Kalestewa, Chopito and Peynetsa families. Characteristic of contemporary Zuni pottery are its thin walls, sculpted frogs and lizards on vessel walls, rims and covers. The \"deer in his house\" and tadpoles are still popular as painted motifs. Although greenware is used and firing occurs in electric kilns, some stick to traditional methods of manufacture.\r\n\r\nJewelers and fetish carvers organized the Zuni Craftsmen Cooperative in 1967, purchasing silver, semi-precious stones and equipment collectively and bringing in their work for sale. The tribe opened its Pueblo of Zuni Arts and Crafts store in 1984, offering silver jewelry and stone fetiches for sale. Weavings, pottery and beadwork were added, and the substantial 1993 enlargement included the addition of a gallery showing acrylics and watercolors. Manager Milford Nahohai generously provides information to visitors. The enterprise aims at maintaining the highest standards in arts and crafts, and offers Zuni arts at two tribal stores in Los Angeles? and ? Adjacent is the small but interesting A:shiwi A:wan tribal museum and heritage center.\r\n\r\nZuni attracts visitors not only by its scenic location and reputation for quality arts and crafts. A major attraction is the restored mission church of Nuestra Senora de Guadelupe and its murals painted by Alex Seowtewa since 1970, depicting Zuni history and culture. A seasonal attraction is the Shalako ceremonies, held between Christmas an New Year to celebrate the passover from the old to the new year. Other dances are held throughout the year, and Zuni dancers also perform at the Gallup Inter-Tribal Ceremonial in August and the McKinley County Fair (held at the pueblo?)." .
