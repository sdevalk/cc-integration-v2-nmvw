Towards the handle it has spike-like stoppers that make it easy to retrieve when it was used. Agbada were made by the Igun Eyeanuguie, members of the Igun-Ematon, who focused on the manufacture of weapons.\r\n\r\nAgbada and Idẹnrhẹn are grouped together as knife and dagger as there is a variety of smaller single- and double-edged daggers and knives which are difficult to distinguish based on the institution data.\r\n\r\nEen metalen dolk met een leren schede." .
