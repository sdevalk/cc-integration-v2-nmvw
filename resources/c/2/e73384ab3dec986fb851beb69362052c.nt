Winnie Mandela frequently wore fashionable hats and headdresses and these are closely linked to her in the public imagination. She wore this hat, designed by the fashion designer Duvall, at the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as South Africa’s first democratically elected president on 10 May 1994." .
