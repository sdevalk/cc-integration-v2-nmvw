Also depicted is Shiva's family: his son Ganesha (top left), his son Murugan (also known as Skanda, bottom left), and his wife Parvati (right hand side). The middle panel at the bottom is a depiction of the temple complex. The \r\nThis is a depiction of the Hindu god Shiva in the form of Nataraja. Nataraja is a localised (South Indian) manifestation of the god. Nataraja is most famously associated with the temple in Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu. In this manifestation, Shiva, known as the 'destroyer', he destroys the universe in a firey dance. \r\n\r\n Although Nataraja has been part of religious life in South India since ca. 530 C.E. (Harp Allen, 1997, 64), it is only in the 20th century that efforts to make Nataraja a 'pan-Hindu' and pan-Indian manifestation of Shiva take hold. The renowed orientalist and art historian, Ananda Coomaraswamy, wrote an essay called 'The Dance of Shiva', where he becomes the patron god of the arts, particularly south Indian female solo dance performance. Before performances, dancers began 'dedicating' their performance to the god, and placed a small statue of Nataraja off to the side of the stage. \r\n\r\nIn the 20th century, Shiva Nataraja statues, particularly bronzes, become valuable items on the art market. They have since become ubiquitous objects in museum and art collections." .
