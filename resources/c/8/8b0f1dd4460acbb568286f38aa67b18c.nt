<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/7240-33> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This sugar bag is from the Hong Kong Taikoo Sugar Refining Co. Ltd. (est. 1881).\r\nIt contained coins 7240-31-1 / 7240-32-62).\r\n\r\nWhen Hilda Blacklaw gave the coins to Laurent Long (c. 1980s), they were kept in this bag, which might include some clues as to their provenance. The English text is basically a complete translation of what is written in Chinese. But we have English pounds and not Chinese catties, the Chinese version confirms the sugar was made in Hong Kong, and we get the meaning of the trade mark: Taikoo i.e. Taigu 太古 “High Antiquity”. We can suppose an old Hong Kong colonial hand had had business with China at the turn of the 20th century and brought back old cash still used as tender in the early Republican era, as well as more contemporary coinage. \r\nThe Hong Kong Taikoo Sugar Refining Co. Ltd. Was established in June 1881. In 1970 it stopped refining sugar. It is now a major sugar importer." .
