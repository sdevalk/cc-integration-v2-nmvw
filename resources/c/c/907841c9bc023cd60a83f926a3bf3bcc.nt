<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-362-210b> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "362-210a-g\r\nSeven Indian hair samples, preserved in glass flasks; 1883.\r\nDuring the second half of the nineteenth century, anthropologists tried to classify ethnic groups on the basis of physical characteristics. Diagnostic traits included the form of skulls, skin color, shape and color of eyes, and stature. Hair could also be classified as to pigmentation, thickness, and degree of curliness. The French anthropologists Paul Broca and Paul Topinard with whom Ten Kate studied in Paris, devised classificatory schemes for all these traits. Like his contemporary colleagues, Ten Kate took photographs en face and en profil, carried out somatological measurements, stole skulls from graves, and collected hair samples during fieldwork. He published the results of his physical anthropological research in North America in a series of articles. An endeavor by Ten Kate and director Lindor Serrurier to establish a physical anthropological collection and found an international scientific periodical entitled \"Notices Anthropologiques du Musée Royal d'Ethnographie de Leyde\" was short-lived because of lack of funding (e.g. Ten Kate 1917; Hovens 1989:75-92). The record of who provided hair samples has been preserved, and they were mostly Pueblo Indians from New Mexico: (a) \"Hosteen Tso, Navajoe, Aged 25,\" (b) \"Joe Navajoe, Aged 18.\" (c) \"Pasqual Lucero, Pueblo of Sandia, Aged 7,\" (d) \"Gonzalez H….?, Aged 8,\" (e) \"Juandra Argin, Pueblo of Isleta, Aged 10,\" (f) \"Francisco Abeyta, Pueblo of Isleta, 10 years,\" and (g) \"Andres Sandoval, Pueblo de Santo Felipe, Aged 18.\" At Ysleta del Sur Ten Kate obtained a hair sample of Bernardo, an Indian who sold a number of artifacts to the anthropologist (Ten Kate 1885/2004:16/72) but it is not known where this ended up." .
