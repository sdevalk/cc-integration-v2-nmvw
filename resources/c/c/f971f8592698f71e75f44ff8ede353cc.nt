Het blad is langwrpig en loopt puntig toe. Aan een zijde een zeer simpele versiering door middel van ingekraste lijnen. Volgens Hr Witte een mannenpagaai.\r\n\r\nThe blade of paddle used by women had carved patterns.\r\nThese decorations are labelled as homo, a term that can be translated as ‘’writing’’ and refers both to sculpting and painting. In addition to aesthetically enhancing artefacts, homo give information about the person, family, and village who owned the object. Specific designs were used by particular groups of people and passed on from one generation to another. Each family or clan had its own designs that were kept. In addition, political alliances between villages were visualised by the use of specific designs. Designs and ornaments have mythological origins. This is suggested by local narratives in which decorations often figure in relation to spirits and  ancestors. The clans used to hold control over  the reproduction of the animal’s images. \r\nThe men's boat had no decoration because they should '' slide through the water like a sword''\r\nWomen's boats were called kayi. They were long, heavy dugout canoe. The larger one could carried some ten to fifteen women. They were used for fishing and for access to the gardens and sago swamps. Unlike the men's boat had carved ornamentation applied to the platform likea prow." .
