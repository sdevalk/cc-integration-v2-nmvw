<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-2008-21> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This ancestor/animal figure representing the mythical sea-snake (salendo) is carved of light wood. It has a long, sharp back, an open mouth with two pig's tusks and is painted in yellow and some red. Across the whole length there are red, black and white lines made by means of seeds. The eyes are also indicated with seeds. The back is covered with cassowary feathers and also with a few white feathers. On both sides there are long round pieces of wood with the ends bend down, painted yellow, decorated with coix seeds and abrus pips and the attached fibre cords. \r\n\r\nThis ornament representing a sea snake was carried by a ceremonial dancer, waiko-ti performer during the ritual celebration connected with the re-enactment of some particular mythical episode. It is a clan emblem representing a totemic ancestor/animal corresponding to the wearer's clan affiliation. Its ritual significance and cultural symbolism is rooted in Marind mythology.  \r\nOne myth narrates about the Diwa-canoe (Diwa is also the name of dema Yugil) in which three dema sailed from Yavar-makan, mayo area to Senayo to attend a big feast celebrating the marriage between Harau and Elme. During their return from the feast a big sea-snake, \"Salendo approached the canoe and stirred up a strong eddy. The canoe, which slowly followed Salendo down the river, had to be relieved of its load and successively a sago-powder, an old woman (who changed into a tortoise), a couple of fishes (hara and karambu, the later a member of the puntius family) and a big load of sago were thrown out. â€¦ Then, at Sirapu, a little distance upstream from Merauke, on the opposite bank, Salendo reappeared and assailed the canoe, which turned upside down\" (ibid.: 312). The dema were left at Sirapu where they live till today. Salendo swam to Anassai where he has remained in a swamp-Mayo up to the present day.\r\nIn ritual myth re-enactment this episode is symbolically represented by means of three wooden human figures inside a boat. This ceremonial, ornamented and painted object is carried on the heads of two decorated men. A few other decorated men follow the boat. One of them wears a head ornament representing the fish, which according to legend followed the boat. The second one wears on his head a figure of the sea snake, with the tusks of a wild pig (Berkhout, L., 1921. Archive RMV, Leiden, series 2008). \r\n\t\t\t\t\t \r\nIVANA HLADKA, 28.11. 2006" .
