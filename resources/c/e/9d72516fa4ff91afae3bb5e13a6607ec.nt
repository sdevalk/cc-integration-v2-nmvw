<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/f2c5ea83b2b6108ecd1aa175832b7b4b> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Ginyginy, manbirri, wulawarri, daygurrpiya: these are the names of the catfish. It belongs to people of the Yirritja moiety. Gupapuyngu people are the Eeltail Catfish people, they call themselves the Daygurrgurr mala or group. Daygurrgurr is the name for calling the eeltail catfish but it ususally refers to the Cupapuyngu clan group. This is why these people sing and dance this particular catfish. The story goes with this as to where the eeltail catfish is from, which country and how it is associated to the Cupapuyngu people. Eeltail catfish is the central and an important  dance and ceremony for the Cupapuyngu people. When holding the dapi ceremony, marratjiri ceremony or when holding a deceased person of the Cupapuyngu and/or of the close relative of these people, who is associated in the way of family line, this is sang and danced. Eeltail catfish is the central and an important role in the life of the Cupapuyngu people today and it has always been. In the Djalumbu (hollow log coffin) ceremony eeltail catfish has an important role in it. This dance is ritually performed when the hollow log coffin is taken out from where it has been prepared and painted. It is then put upright in the ground where the mpeople has been dancing for the last few weeks.\r\n\r\nIn the late wet season - March to April - many fish such as the barramundi travel inland with the incoming tides. When these tides meet the wet season run-off from the land they flood the large coastal plains. During this time it is possible to spear fish by wading across the plains. Many fish spawn and new generations are created. Conditions are good for the young with insect life and debris in the run-off water.\r\n\r\nThe Ginginy (Eeltail catfish) are translucent when young (about 3-6\" long) and the herringbone pattern of their backbone is clearly visible. A long time ago, close to the beginning of time, a spirit man called Murayana; really called Mangilili, Gurwirriwirryar and Rraparangmanang made the first hollow Log and Marradjirri pole and the Diver Duck totem. When they finished they had painted their bodies with the catfish design and threw the log into the sacred well where it sank into the deepest part. The baby catfish are thought to be the souls of deceased and unborn people. In real life these fish inhabit fallen logs in watercourses.\r\n\r\nRAMINGINING\r\nRamingining is a small community of around 590 people, of whom about 30 are non-Aboriginal people, mostly advisors or teacherrs of some sort or another. The village itself is located some 400 kms to the east of Darwin, and nearly 30 kms from the Arafura Sea. It is a relatively new settlement, having only been established in the early 1970's. \r\nRamingining is situated upon the richest bauxite deposit (outside Nhulunboy) in Australia, possibly the world. The missionaries realised this and deliberately established the community at the present site to thwart mining company develeopment and associated problems as present in Nhulunboy.\r\n\r\nEarlier, in the 1960's an outstation of Milingimbi was set up at Nangalalala [ 8 kms N/E of Ramingining], a kilometre or so from the Glyde River. Ther older settlement Milingimbi Mission, was established in 1926 and is in fact situated on an island a few kilometres off the north Australia coastline. Nangala is still in existence, and is now considered an outstation of Ramingining.\r\nThe area around Ramingining on the mainland is home for the Djinang speaking Wurrkigenydjarr/Marrangu, Wulaki, Mildjingi, Balmbi and Murrungun clans.  In a wider circle are the Burarra, Rembarrnga, Wudamin, Ganalbingu and Manharrngu peoples. To the north are the Gorryindi, Gamalangga, Malarra and Walamangu peoples who look after the Crocodile Islands. Other people who live there and have ceremonial connections are members of the Gupapuyngu, Djambarrpuyngu, Wagilag, Liyagalawumir and Liya-gawumirr groups.  \r\nThe particular tract of land upon which Ramingining township is built is owned by the Djadawitjibi people, of the Djiang group. Their principal creative being is Garrtjambal, the kangaroo.\r\nSome 10-20 kms to the south of the village of Ramingining, where the looping Glyde River becomes the Goyder, is the large Arafura Swamp. Some 250 sq kms in area, this unique fresh water environment is home for an innumerable variety of water birds (including gurramatji, the magpie goose), fresh water plants, fields of water lilies, crocodiles, water snakes, insect life, and the magnificent and rare Corypha elata palm. (hundred year palm?).\r\nRamingining is situated upon the richest bauxite deposit (outside Nhuunboy) in Australia, possibly the world. The missionaries realised this and deliberately established the community at the present site to thwart mining company development and associated problems as present in Nhulunboy.\r\n\r\nThe Art\r\nThe art of Ramingining has always been highly prized and is still today pursued by some of the best known living artists in Arnhemland Land. However until the 70's, when the settlement of Ramingining was established, most of the art work of this area was circulated to the outside world either through the Art Centre at Milingimbi, or the Government settlement of Maningrida, some 80 kms to the west towards Darwin.\r\nNow the Art Centre at Ramingining has come into its own; somewhat ironically, it now services the older settlement at Milingimbi. The result of this change in the last decade is that now all art is chanelled beyond the region of its production through the Ramingining community's own Art Co-operative, Bulabula Arts.\r\nThis is a locally owned and controlled artists co-operative whose role is to 'market' the work of local painters, weavers, and sculptors to the outside world. The responsibility of the Centre is to show the works with the status and respect they deserve, and to show other people Aboriginal culture, in a way that may educate them.\r\n\r\nOrigins\r\nEvery Aboriginal person comes from a creator being, known as wangarr, in this region. These spiritual beings took many forms, moving across the land and sea, forming and shaping the landscape.\r\nAs these beings travelled they imparted the 'life force' in that place for the Aboriginal people who were affiliated to that 'country' or land tract. They gave the people their langauages, songs, ceremonies, law, social customs, and technology. Always they wore the proper body ornaments and carried with them the life-giving rranga, sacred images of the wangarr, and girri, the wordly posessions each person needed for survival. They also gave each person/group their land." .
