Deze werd speciaal door Dorothy Trujillo voor Margot Spiegel gemaakt.\r\n\r\nCochito pottery was traditionally slipped in white-cream-light gray, and painted in black and red. Cochiti Pueblo stands out as a center of the manufacture of pottery figurines, both human and animal. Production increased dramatically when Santa Fe traders purchased such figurines for a rapidly expan¬ding tourist market after the intercontinental railroad was completed in 1883. However, the technical and artistic quality deterio¬rated quickly as emphasis was on mass production. Because of their crude shapes, these figures were referred to as \"monos\", the Spanish name for \"monkeys\". However, between 1910 and 1930 a number of potters turned to producing figuri¬nes of high quality.\r\n\r\nPotter Laurencita Herrera (1912-1984) and her husband Nestor Herrera, a drum maker, headed a whole family of potters. The daughters Mary Herrera (d. 1991) and Seferina Ortiz (b. 1931) learned the craft from their mother, concentrating on bowls, water jars and figurines. Seferina began experimen¬ting with miniature clay figurines in the 1960s, gradually doing larger pieces and quickly became an expert at making lifelike images of people and animals. Through this work she not only inspired her own children Joyce Lewis (b. 1954), Janice (b. 1956), Inez (b. 1960) and Virgil (b. 1969), but also her sister and moth-er. People, including circus people and storytellers, and bears are the most popular subjects. The work of Virgil Ortiz, human figures mocking whites from various walks of life, is the most innovative and artistically accomplished. Miniature figurines and pots are also made, including nativity scenes (Dillingham 1994:119-128).\r\n\r\nHelen Cordero (b. 19  ) had a major impact on Pueblo pottery by creating her first \"storyteller\" figure, a woman crowded upon by little children listening to her tales. Since the late 1960s the storyteller figuri¬ne has become an icon of Pueblo pottery and is being sculpted in many Indian villages in New Mexico. A popular variation is the story¬telling bear with cubs (Babcock and Monthan 1986).\r\n\r\nAda Suina\r\n\r\nSeferina Ortiz who came from a long line of potters began making pottery in the late 1950s and specialized in figures of animals and people. Four of her six children have also learned the craft. Virgil Ortiz has become an outstanding potter of large outlandisch and at the same time somehow familiar figures of a variety of people, including circus people and performers, carnival personae and types dressed up in sexually explicit attire. His success in the marketplace enabled him to open a training center for young potters in his village, thus contribuiting to the economic viability of the pueblo, and the continuity of a successful pottery tradition.\r\n\r\nCochiti is also known for its artists working in watercolors and the manufacture of cottonwood drums used in Pueblo dances and ceremonies beyond Cochiti." .
