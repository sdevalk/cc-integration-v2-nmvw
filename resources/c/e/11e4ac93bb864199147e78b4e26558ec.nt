<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/6f0a8d7a270da8514710cdaae242e173> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This arm band is made from glass beads and plant fibre.\r\nThe manufacture of this jewellery is the job of the women. First, they made a bundle of wooden sticks which they wrapped in a palm leaf. This had the size of the arm the arm band was intended for. Around this pipe the woman plaited the arm band. A double plant fibre is always tied around once. One of them is further used to entwine with the first thread. This is done with little loops. In these loops, glass beads are inserted. This makes for a closely woven bead work. \r\nThis exemplar was made with white, black and red glass beads. Black and red triangles sit on a white background. \r\n\r\nWomen and men wear these on their upper arm. It seems that the beaded jewellery has replaced the traditional materials like orchid fibre and coix seeds. It is not known when exactly the arm band was purchased but considering the material and also the seemingly modern design, it is likely that it dates from a time recent to the date of acquisition (1949)." .
