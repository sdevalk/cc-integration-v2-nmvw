And Hasan al-\r\n       Basri moved excitedly, surrounded by servants and slave-girls \r\n       who carried on their heads very large trays full of gold\r\n       pieces and dinars and confetti. When the bride wove her way\r\n       to him and stood before him, he kept staring at her,\r\n       contemplating the beauty which God had bestowed on her alone,\r\n       while the servants scattered the gold pieces over the heads\r\n       of the young & the old. And he was happy, and rejoiced at\r\n       what he saw.\r\n2)   [T] Arches France" .
