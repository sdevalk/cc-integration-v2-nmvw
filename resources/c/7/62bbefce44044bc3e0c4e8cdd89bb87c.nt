Lemaire, Amsterdam, 1950.\r\n\r\n\r\nTlingit artists of the nineteenth century often carved small illustrative figures in the general character of this intriguing example. A wide range of images can be seen in figures of this kind, and it seems that no two were ever carved just alike. Often intended to depict characters known from ancient stories, these figures illustrate the kinds of relationships between humans, animals, and spirits that were part of the traditional belief system of the Native world.\r\n\r\n\tIllustrative figures of this kind are related to the kinds of small figures carved by and for shamans, the traditional native spiritual doctors. Shamans employed small figures that represented their spirit helpers in the rituals that were intended to cure their patients. Ethnographic literature states that such figures were sometimes left with the patients as a kind of talisman, to better effect a cure. Other figures were made that represented the shamans themselves. These often included small painted leather garments of the types the shamans wore, and sets of miniature masks that replicated the full sized set owned and used by the shaman in his practice. Most shamans figures of either type mentioned here were small, between about 18 and 23 centimeters in height.\r\n\r\n\tThis figure, which is a fairly large one for its kind, depicts a man with a large halibut held with the tail in his mouth. It appears as though the halibut has just exited the man’s mouth, to be caught in his hands. The fish is easily recognizable as a halibut because of the unusual evolutionary development that put both of the fish’s eyes on the same side of its head. This is important for bottomfish of this type, including sole and flounder, so that they have the binocular advantage of two eyes while their wide, thin bodies either lay right on the sandy bottoms or swim along just above them in search of food.\r\n \r\n\tHalibut were not only important for use as food, and an excellent quality of food at that, which could be preserved for long periods by smoking and drying, but were also important as the emblems of certain clans. Halibut images have appeared on totem poles, painted housefronts, and carved dishes used for serving and eating at feasts and important gatherings. The Tlingit and other Northwest Coast people created ingenious two-piece wooden hooks for catching halibut, which employed either bone or metal points to pierce the halibut’s cheek. These hooks were carved in two sections and bound together with spruce root to measurements of the maker’s hands. The size of the hook was dictated by the size of halibut intended to be caught. Smaller, younger fish could not swallow the hook and attached bait, and ones that were too large to handle could not get their mouth into the business opening of the hook either. The largest, so-called ‘barn-door’ halibut can be as long as 180-270 centimeters, and weigh as much as 240 kilos. By only targeting the mid-range sizes of fish, these hooks also protected the resource from unnecessary depletion in the customary harvest areas close to the villages. Modern, non-selective fishing methods can wipe out a population of fish in a very short time, as history has clearly shown.\r\n\r\n\tThe face of the man holding the halibut in this figure is carved in a traditional Tlingit style, with the broad eyebrows, wide lips, and rounded nostrils that are often, though not always, encountered in that style of sculpture. The style of carving can be related to certain masks that may be the same artist’s work, though no name is known for this carver. In its appearance, the work suggests that it was carved between about 1870 and 1890, a time when large numbers of outsiders took advantage of improved steamship access to visit southeast Alaska and purchase mementos of their journey. Tlingit carvers, particularly in Sitka, one of the oldest and most-visited towns in the region, appear to have responded to this new market for their work by creating fairly large numbers of this kind of sculpture. The quality of such carvings varied, but most of them, including this fine example, were made by artists who had a great deal of experience carving traditional works, and were able to adapt those skills to serve a new clientele.\r\n\r\nSteven C.
