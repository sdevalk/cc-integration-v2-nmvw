<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/IB2020-2-5> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Across Oceania, tapa cloth was transformed over the colonial period: textiles not only featured new motifs but were created in new\r\nforms as people abandoned ancestral religion and made Christianity a new focus for sociality and the imagination of history and identity. On Rarotonga, precolonial cloth bore dark and dense zigzag patterns and was used to wrap sculpted wooden 'staff' gods, many of which were destroyed or offered up to missionaries in the 1820s. This painted textile, in an entirely different style, is one of very few extant from the mid-nineteenth century. It depicts the facade of the newly-built church at Titikaveka on Rarotonga's south coast. No doubt loosely inspired by the images in printed missionary literature, or possibly by sketching undertaken by European men and women associated with the mission, the representational element is fully assimilated within an indigenous aesthetic: the linear designs, reminiscent of tattoo motifs, imply vitality and sanctity, while plants evoke the botanical adornment of houses, ritual sites and the person, which was (and is part of the aesthetic of the environment and daily life across Polynesia. The early label refers to the cloth as a 'flag' made by a 'boy' for a Christian celebration; it may be that paintings of this kind were held up during public ceremonies that brought the community together. \r\n\r\n(Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts p. 304)" .
