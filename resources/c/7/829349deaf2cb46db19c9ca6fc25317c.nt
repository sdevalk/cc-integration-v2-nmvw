<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/0e19c3cb46e63665a05510bdf1713053> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Elegant, inventive weapons and utensils hold a central place in Aboriginal material arts. Artists go to great lengths to select a branch or root of three with the best qualities, considering the function of the weapon. Heavy hardwoods were used to make narrow shields needed to deflect attach from a club or boomerang, whereas broader, flat shields were required for defence against spears, and could be made of lighter timber. All over Australia, the surfaces of most shields, clubs and spear throwers were decorated. In the south they used very fine engravings and in the north complex painted surfaces. In the design and manufacture of weapons, tools and other utensils, primary consideration was given to their effectiveness and portability. Each item had to be carried, often for long distances, and therefore if one piece could perform several tasks is saved the burden of having too many possessions. Although simple, the weapons and implements  were so ingeniously designed that a few light, transportable tools equipped nomadic people with the means of obtaining all their daily requirements." .
