Aan de achterzijde is een handgreep uitgespaard. Op de convexe voorzijde is met verf een kruis aangebracht.\r\n\r\nOval shield from the Bundock collection at Leiden. This example seems to show hurried construction, especially in making the handle and the inset handhold, European influence is evident in the decoration.\r\n\r\nOval shield in light-weight, light-coloured wood, undercorated except for a cross painted in the centre of the convex upper surface. The handle is cut into the solid wood of the body of the shield. This shield seems to be an incomplete, or hurriedly made excample, perhaps to illustrate the type of shield common in the area. The wood is the same as that used for the other, more carefully made and decorated examples, in this collection and at Liverpool. The handle and inset handhole have been very roughly cut and burnt into the wood of the shield, not clearly incised with short sharp cuts and right angle edges as in the other examples. The decoration on the surface is quite uncharacteristic, to judge from that on other shields in this series, and seems to have been made with lead paint rather than natural pigments.\r\n\r\nShields The oval shield, plano-convex in cross-section, with the handle cut from the solid wood of the body of the shield itself, and made of very light-weight wood, the upper surface often painted, seems to be a shield type characteristic of the north coast of New South Wales, from the Macleay to the Richmond and Tweed Rivers. It is quite distinct from the oval shield of U-shaped section with the handle made from a separate length of vine or supple wood inserted through two holes cut into the body of the shield. This type of schield is recorded for the New South Wales coast from Port Macquarie south to Port Jackson (see Dick 1915).\r\n\r\nThe examples donated to the Leiden museum by Miss Bundock are said by the donor to be made from the wood of the Meryta sinclairii, also light-weight and soft, so probably very similar to that of the tree traditionally chosen to provide the wood for shields. The requirements here are a wood which is serviceable and tough, but also light to carry and use in combat. These examples must have been made in the years following settlement in the Richmond, as the tree is an import, the New Zealand Pukani. A small tree, not at all frost tolerant, so well suited to the mild winters of the Richmond valley, it was grown as a garden plant prized for its decorative leaves (Anderson 1968:301).\r\n\r\nThe shields compare with those of south-east Queensland in construcion, but differ from those os the coastal river valleys to the south. The region of the Tweed, Richmond, and Clarence Rivers would seem, in terms of meterial culture, to form a distinct unit.\r\n\r\nThe distinctness of the area is seen again in the plain clubs and the decoration of the painted wooden shields. The finely incised geometric and linear patterns characteristic of the shields, clubs, and boomerangs, of western and central areas of New South Wales are not found. Unfortunately our collection of shields (the only highly decorated item) is insufficient to allow detailed analysis of the design elements in the decoration. Black, white and red are the only colours used. They are also the colours used for the drawings in rock shelter sites in the Richmond region. Yellow pigments were either unavailable or not favoured. However there seems to be no stylistic link between the motifs of the rock art and the designs used to decorate the shields." .
