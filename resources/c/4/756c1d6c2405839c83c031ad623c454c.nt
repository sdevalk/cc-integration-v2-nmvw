There are several other kinds of straw mat, made from rice straw, wheat straw and other straws, and in varying qualities of texture, from very fine to coarse, whatever the material of the mat, and whatever its texture, on a summer's evening in the countryside people lounge on it around a friendly fire out in the yard.\r\nGangwha Island, off the west coast just a couple hours drive from Seoul is regarded as the producer of the finest quality mat. The sedge which grows there is of a higher quality that elsewhere. They make two kinds of mats on Gangwha. One is made from practically any kinds of straw that can be used in a mat. The straw is hung from a horizontal pole at the top of a frame; each string is weighted at the bottom and with a stone. At the top, a piece of straw is laced horizontally through the perpendicular strands and a knot is tied at every juncture with a perpendicular strand. This is the coarser kind, both because the straw is usually not sedge, and because of the knots. The other kind is of finer quality. Sedge is always used, and the sedge strands are tightly woven, not knotted." .
