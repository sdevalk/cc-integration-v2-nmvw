Centraal op de achterzijde bevindt zich een knop met daarin een gat. Hierdoor kon het koord voor het vasthouden van de spiegel worden gehaald. Ook was het hierdoor mogelijk de spiegel op een stok te steken en aldus op te houden.\r\n\r\nBronze mirrors were an important part of the personal accoutrements of those of higher rank from very early times, and in fact a small mirror was even discovered in a Qijia culture tomb dating to around 2000 B.C.. The great age of Chinese bronze mirrors, however, lasted from the Late Warring States period to the end of the Tang. The \"lion and grapevine\" pattern mirror is very characteristic of the Tang dynasty and is rich in the kind of Middle Eastern influence which came to China through the Silk Road. This example is crisply cast with two principal fields, an outer one in which running \"lions\" chase after pairs of different kinds of birds, and an inner one in which six \"lions\" gambol around a seventh forming the central knop. It is interesting that one of the \"lions\" is clearly in a state of sexual excitement - reminiscent of the satyrs of the classical world.\r\n\r\nSome Han mirrors have astronomical or astrological patterns. The most elaborate, particularly popular during the Hsin dynasty (AD 9-25), bears the so-called TLV pattern. These angular shapes, ranged around the main band of decoration between a central square zone and the outer border band, are believed to be linked to a cosmological \"chess\" game called liu-po; the decoration also may include creatures symbolic of the four directions, immortals, and other mythical beings popular in Taoist folklore. Often the mirrors carry inscriptions, varying from a simple expression of good luck to a long dedication giving the name of the maker and referring to the Shang-fang or Imperial workshop. In the Eastern Han the Taoist elements dominated mirror design, which often includes the legendary Queen Mother of the West, Hsi Wang Mu, and her royal eastern counterpart, Tung Wang Kung. The coming of Buddhism at the end of the Han dynasty caused a decline in the use of cosmological mirrors. Mirror making, however, was revived in the 'ang dynasty.\r\n\r\nMany of the finest Sui and Tang bronze mirrors were made at Yangzhou on the Grand Canal. Decoration, cast in high relief or repoussé, includes auspicious motifs, Taoist scenes, and the 12 zodiacal animals. The \"lion and grape\" mirror was very popular in the 7th and 8th centuries, for it embodied both Chinese directional and \"five phases\" symbolism, and lions and grapes were also potent symbols in the Manichaean faith introduced by the Uighur from Central Asia. This type of mirror disappeared abruptly with the persecution of the Manichaeans in 843." .
