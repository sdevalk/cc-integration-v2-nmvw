All of the objects come from various farms where these families lived in the former Cape province in South Africa. The most notable being the `Elandsdrift' farm in the Karoo (North Cape province). This farm and the family living there was well known, and mentioned in a book by the well-known South African poet and writer Guy Butler who lived in the area, and several other books from the period.\r\nThe objects represent a cross-section of rural life of white South Africans – both Afrikaans and English speaking in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Especially notable are the objects related to women and children." .
