She is also associated with the zodiacal animal of the Snake and hence, in Japanese belief, with water. Shrines devoted to the popular goddess are therefore usually constructed bordering on the water or even, as here, on an island in the Inokashira Pond in the town of Mitaka in the western outskirts of the city. The Inokashira Pond takes its water from the Kanda River. The Benten Shrine was built in 1636." .
