<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/8b3527bc1640e046eaa23729d8ffc4aa> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The double canoe is an adjustment of single outrigger canoe made specially for the annual migration from Manihiki to Rakahanga. The two canoes are arranged in parallel in such a way that prow of one tally with the other stern. This unique disposition permits to navigate easily in both directions. Mast and sails are erected in the leeward canoe whereas the passengers take place in the other one.\r\n\r\nThe whole population once lived on one atoll at a time and moved back and forth from one atoll to the other when forced to do so by depletions of the coconut and puraka (species of taro) supplies.  Yet under the missionary influence the migrations led to the abandonment of the annual migrations between Manihiki and Rakahanga." .
