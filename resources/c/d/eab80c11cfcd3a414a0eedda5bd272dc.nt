He confronts the museum directly regarding his desire for the piece: “a museum shouldn’t simply be an institution that displays the culture and history of the other; it should instead present a critical reflection on the cultural and historical vision of world history in which the West as a dominant power occupies a central place...the problem with Western thinking is that always tries to classify, categorize and class things, even if these things are sometimes impossible to classify.”\r\n\r\nHis piece consists of two outdoor vitrines stacked with 40 photocopies of original paintings and a video installation in the center. The topic of this work is regarding the historical imperial garden, Yuanmingyuan in Beijing. It was a garden created in the 16-17 century during the Qing dynasty, which sported influence from both Chinese craftsman and architects and European collaborators. This garden only remains as a memory, captured in map drawings and paintings after it was burned in 1860 by the French and English. Zhen considers this to be an important example of cross-cultural influence and informs us with his title: A lesson of Ethnology. His work seeks to trace the multiple manifestations of this historical example of interaction and interchange. The photocopies in his piece are bound to glass and display the maps to mimic an archive or ‘traditional museum display.’ This coupled with the video work in the center of the sculpture features a recording of the current state of the garden, what has come of it, and its historical roots. \r\n\r\nIn his commentary on the ethnographic museum, Zhen creates a piece which does not feature one object of material culture as the storyteller, but instead creates a system of activation where the original event explores placement in the past, present, and future. He cites his concept as the desire to “make reappear this formal tragedy which was occurred for the most of Europeans is to “offer a gift” to the Museum of Ethnology. It is also a “crucial ethnological object:” a trace of construction and destruction of culture for enlarging and enriching the idea and vision of such a kind of museum. It concerns not only the objects but the acts behind the materials.” \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that due to his untimely death, the piece was completed by his widow and life long-time collaborator, Xu Min, in 2003." .
