Similar coats with provenance originate from the western shores of Hudson Bay at either York Factory (est. 1684) or Fort Prince of Wales (est. 1717). European fur traders depended on the local people for food, labor and commerce. They could not survive without their cooperation and support. Many took Cree women as country wives, and fur trade forts became domestic spaces where knowledge systems merged and new communities were created by generations of children who embodied the cultural inheritance of both parents. The coat was one of the first garments to become imbued with meaning in these intimate interactive zones, merging its form with ancient functions.\r\n \r\nIn 1743, James Isham at York Factory translated ‘garment’ as tacope and the Cree word muska togy as “tockey” or “toggey” (Rich 1949:14). Samuel Hearne wrote in his 1774 journal that he had given “each of the People a Dresst Moose Skin to make them a Toggey for the Winter” (Rich 1951:205n). In 1821 Nicholas Garry shipped several cases of “Curiousities” home to England, including two garments, described as a “painted leather Toggy with Porcupine Epaulets and trimmed with Otter skin” (1900:37).\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits first documented the practice of draping finely ornamented hides around the shoulders in gestures of alliance and diplomacy (du Poisson n.d.). At York Factory and other trading posts, elaborate trading ceremonies developed where European traders gifted military-style coats trimmed with gilt braid to prominent men and received gifts in return (Carlos and Lewis 2010:73). These two traditions merged in the painted hide coat. They became an essential form of winter clothing worn well into the nineteenth century.\r\n \r\nA survey of museums in Canada and Europe identified sixteen surviving coats of early indigenous manufacture. Although similar, each coat is unique. Nine have distinct painted “T” shapes down the center back. Created from single large moose hides, the coats are cut along the length of the hide. As the hide once wrapped around the animal, the garment wraps around the body. The man inside the garment aligned his spine with the spine of the animal.  Bone tools embossed lines into the hide and paint was pressed into the shapes. A column of alternating sun-circles and rectangles emphasized and echoed the spine. Along the shoulder blades, alternating blocks filled with circles and rectangles create a short horizontal line. The “T” is outlined with a border of stamped circles, alternating red and indigo blue. The skirt has a deep border of three rows: half circles representing the celestial world alternate with circles and rectangles divided into quadrants by the ordinal directions. Two rows of triangles border the coat opening and fine loom porcupine quillwork with wrapped fringe ornaments the shoulders. Each individual fringe along the skirt is meticulously wrapped with porcupine quill.\r\n\r\nThese enigmatic garments represent a range of cross-currents: diplomatic protocols, trade, alliance, adaptation and exchange. Through these activities and the resulting human relationships, indigenous materials, construction techniques and garment forms encountered European goods, new techniques and imported clothing. The coats present an opportunity to explore complex social networks that were home to the construction of new forms of cultural knowledge. Women created the coats for men (both Indigenous and European), who occupied radically different positions, and communicated important information in the complex designs woven and painted onto their surface.\r\n\r\nSherry Farrell Racette\r\nUniversity of Manitoba, Winnipeg \r\n\r\n\r\nAnn M.
