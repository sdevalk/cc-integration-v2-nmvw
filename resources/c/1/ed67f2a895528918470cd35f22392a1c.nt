An example as follows: Ndjébbana: muya or nganamiddja, Kunwinjku: wayarra or narmarnde, Nakkara: nawangarra, Yoln Matha: mokuy, Mawng: manja, Kriol: debildebil.\r\n\r\nWangarra is a generic term which can include both spirit of a recently deceased person. Although these two classes of spirits can be referred to as wangarra they should not be confused as the same beings.\r\n\r\nSome wangarra inhabit certain sacred sites and are especially associated with monsoon vine thickets, where it is dark and cool. Others are said to live in the hollows of trees or to stand tall imitating the spear grass which appears in the wet season. At a location near the Burarra outstation community of Wurdeja in the Blyth River district is a sacred palm tree (Gronophyllum ramsayii) which is said tob e watched over by a particular wangarra spirit. Aboriginal people travelling in vehicles past this tree sometimes throw cigarettes on the ground near the base of the tree to appease the wangarra. Generally speaking, wangarra are often said to be profane spirits depicted with human forms with malevolent looking faces. Some are dangerous to humans whilst others are merely mischievous or indifferent.\r\nThe spirits of the recently deceased are said to inhabit places they frequented when they were alive. In order to free themselves from the troublesome and disturbing influence of these wangarra, the relatives of the deceased will perform a ceremony which involves ‘ smoking’ an area by burning the leaves of the Ironwood tree (Erythrophleum chlorostachys) accompanied to special songs.\r\nSome wangarra are a particular dreaming totem for people of certain clans. This is why many artits depict wangarra (or whatever name each clan uses fort hem) in their bark paintings and sculptures. They are depicting clan totems particular to their lineage and which are celebrated in major regional patrimoiety ceremonies.\r\n\r\nThis text is copyright  Maningrida Arts and Culture 1995" .
