Yvan, Paris, 1885\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThis man’s headdress consists of a crown of eagle tail feathers, standing upright in the fold of a Native-tanned skin headband, of which the front is covered with loom-woven porcupine quillwork. The triangular and box-patterns are executed in several shades of red, green, yellow and black or blue. Rawhide strips wrapped with quills are attached to the shafts of the feathers. Remnant of red-dyed hair wisps and white ermine fur are glued to the tips of the feathers. As indicated by some remnants, short black feathers used to fill the spaces between the eagle feathers. The headdress was purchased together with a man’s costume (RMV 524-2 and 3), identified as of Plains Cree origin, and dating from the 1840s.\r\n\r\n\tThe geometric designs of the woven quillwork identify also the origin of this headdress as Cree, ca. 1840. The use of shaft-decorated eagle feathers suggests an origin from southwestern Manitoba. The decoration of eagle feathers with quill-wrapped strips seems to have spread from the Missouri River onto the northern Plains. Feathered headbands once were common throughout the eastern regions of North America. Several early examples from the Great Lakes area are preserved in museum collections, but this feathered headband in the Leiden collection may well be the only one surviving example from the Plains.\r\n\r\n\tFeathered headbands disappeared when a headdress with flaring feather arrangement became popular. This flaring type has a cap as its base, and the attachment of the feathers allows them to move with motion. Spreading from the Central Plains in the 1820s it became the stereotypical “Indian war bonnet.” The older arrangement of rigidly upright feathers (though now on a cap) survived in the “straight-up” headdress of the Blackfoot Indians, who also continued to decorate the feathers with quill-wrapped strips. This type of headgear could also be worn by women, and is still used by members of Sacred Horn and Motokik societies of the Siksika.\r\n\r\nTed J.
