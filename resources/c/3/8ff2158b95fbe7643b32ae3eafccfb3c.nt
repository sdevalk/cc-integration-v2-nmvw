<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/28272c57b96e578ed052ad4618bf4c37> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This piece was commissioned through the Re-Design of the Volkenkunde public works commission entitled: Beelden rondom Volkenkunde or the Garden of Eden project in 1999. It originally was housed in the Oceania section of the Volkenkunde Museum and now resides in the Tropenmuseum.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shirts were given to the Asmat people, and re-fashioned according to a fashion style and method they had created of their own. The shirts were then collected back by Roy Villevoye from the Asmat people and brought to the Netherlands to be displayed, in total there were 100 shirts. These were sent back with photos from the original owners, and a book entitled Red Calicio was also made to document the process.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his artist proposal Villevoye goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\"A museum of Ethnology collects things from others and thereby represents and reconstructs a way of life. Attempts are generally made to provide insight by showing isolated and private image. A solemn presentation hardly makes contact with living people, however. In such displays, Asmat papuas as portrayed as exotic, naked, painted people with nasal bones. Photos on which papuas with clothing or other worldly things can be seen, quickly fall into the category of showings of an already damaged culture. It seems difficult to accept that even there people are looking forward to beautiful, new Western stuff that is effortlessly integrated and appropriated with a complex framework.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nThrough these pieces he wanted to create work for the commission which brought the methods of viewing into question in the museum. He creates contemporary art which engages ethnographic practice to such an extent the line of division blurs." .
