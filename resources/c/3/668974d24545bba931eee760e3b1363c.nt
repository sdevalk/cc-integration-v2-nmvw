Men veronderstelt dat zij de oermoeders van alle hedendaagse Dhuwa Aboriginals zijn die in het gebied leven. Hun ceremonie is de Dhuwa Ngara, de hoogste van die moiety.\r\nDe Djang'kawu; twee zusters en hun broer kwamen van de zon (het oosten) met de kano van het eiland van de doden (hemel) naar het land van de Arnhem Land clans en kwamen aan land in Yelangbara (Port Bradshaw), ten zuiden van Yirrkala. Ze zagen dat het land droog en dor was. Ze droegen heilige graafstokken met zich mee die gebruikten voor het graven naar yams en het het vinden van waterplaatsen doordat zij de punten van hun graafstokken in de grond staken om waterbronnen te scheppen. In de bron plaatsten ze heilige totems die bij dat land hoorden en die zodoende het water lieten stijgen en overstromen om het land vruchtbaar te maken.De waterplaatsen, de Zusters, en het hele verhaal zijn vaak afgebeeld door een \" union jack\" achtig patroon die de waterplaats en de zon voorstellen waar de vrouwen vandaan kwamen.De andere heilige graafstokken staken ze in de grond en werden Djota bomen die rondom de bron gingen groeien.De water goanna (hagedis), Djarrka klimt op de zonnige takken van deze bomen om te drogern nadat hij gejaagd heeft in het water. Omdat deze goanna's in en uit de heilige watrerbron komen raken ze gevuld met totemische kracht.Zij zijn de bewakers van de bronnen. De Vrouwen droegen heilige \"dilly\" tassen die gedecoreerd waren met heilige patronen en versierd met kwasten. Ze droegen Heilige Rranga opgerold in Nganyal, conische matten. Toen ze naar het Noorden en Westen langs de kust trokken gebruikten de Zusters de graafstokken als wandelstokken en maakten waterplaatsen en de wetten voor de Dhuwa clansin de thuislanden waar zij doorheen trokken.Zij lieten hun wetten achter in de vorm van deze heilige waterbronnen, krachtvoorwerpen en tekens in het landschap, gaven voor elke clan de totems en ceremonieen namen.\r\nIn Gariyak (Hutchinson Straat) reisden de Djang'kawu Zusters door een moddervlakte. Tijdens de reis plaatsten zij hun graafstokken in de grond en er verschenen waterbronnen.  Zij schonken de liederen, dansenn en \"rranga\" heilige ceremonie aan het Buyu'yukulmirr (Garrawurra) volk. Ze verschenen ook om de Malarra clan te onderwijzen hoe ze moesten zingen en hun ceremoniele rituelen uit te voeren.  Het Garrawurra volk werd geleerd hoe ze zichzelf en de dupun, holle boomstammen, moesten beschilderen. Die miny'tji wordt 'djirrididi' genoemd- de kleuren zijn: geel, rood en wit en ze behoren alleen tot de Buyu'yukulmirr clan.\r\nKunstenaars zeggen dat de strepen getijdenstrepen voorstellen. Dode holle boomstammen worden weggedreven door de vloed tijdens het natte moesson jaargetijde en drijven de rivieren af naar de moddervlakten aan de kust. Hier raken ze ingebed in de modder en worden gemarkeerd door de opeenvolgende binnenkomende getijden. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nDjang'kawu sisters, Miny'tji- banded body design, also represents tidal marks in the sand.\r\n\r\nThe Djang'kawu are most probably the most important power beings in the religion of North Eastern Arnhem Land. They are believed to be the original mothers of all present day Dhuwa Aboriginals living in the area. Their ceremony is the Dhuwa Ngara ceremony, the highest of that moiety.\r\nThe Djang'kawu; two sisters  and their brother came from the sun (east) by canoe from the island of the dead (heaven) to the land of the Arnhem Land clans and landed at Yelangbara (Port Bradshaw), south of Yirrkala. They found the land dry and barren. They carried sacred digging sticks with sticks with them which they used for digging yams and finding underground water. When the points of their ndigging sticks with them which they used for digging yams and finding underground water.When the points of their digging sticks were pushed into the ground to create water holes.Into the well they placed sacred totems for that country which made the water rise and over5flow the land fertilising it. The water holes, the Sisters, and the whole whole story are often represented by a \"union jack\" type designdepicting the water hole and the sun from whence the women came. They put other sacred sticks into the ground that turned into Djota trees to grow around the well. The water goanna Djarrka climbs sunny branches of thes trees to dry after hunting in the water. Because these goanns move in and out of the sacred well, they become filled with totemic power. They are guardians of the wells.\r\nThe Women carried sacred 'dilly' bags decorated with sacred designs and tassels. They carried Sacred Rranga rolled up in Nganyal; conical mats. Heading north and west along the coast the Sisters used sticks as walking sticks and made the water holes and the law for the Dhuwa clans in the homelands they travelled through. They left their law in the form of these sacred wells, power objects, and marks on the countryside, naming the totems and the ceremonies for each clan.\r\n\r\n\r\nGariyak\r\nAt Gariyak (Hutchinson Strait)  the Djang'kawu Sisters travelled along the mud plain. While travelling along and where ever the points of their ' sacred sticks' went into the ground it left waterholes in its place. They gave the songs, dances and \"rranga\" sacred ceremony to the Buyu'yukulmirr (Garrawurra) people were taught how to paint themselves for dance with ''\r\nminydji' stripes that they also use on bark paintings and dupun, the hollow logs. That minydji is called 'djirrididi' colours are: yellow, red and white and belongs to Buyu'yukulmir clan only.\r\nArtists say that the stripes represent tidal marks. Dead hollow logs are carried awqay by wet season monsoon floods and float down the rivers tot the coastal mud flats. Here they become embedded in the mud and are marked by succesive incoming tides.\r\n\r\nDhamala\r\nAt Dhamala on the western mouth of the Glyde River the sisters walked across the mud flats, mangrove shores and clay pan plains and made Manharrngu country. Their name comes from the Manyarr mangrove trees associated with the Sisters. Here they rested and cleared their hair of nits (lice) in the shade of trees there. All over this flat area they dug water holes which bubbled to life, the water overflowing the plain.\r\nAt another tree they hung their sacred dilly bags on the branches to hunt in the nearby pond to catch fish and other delicacies. While they were away men crept up and made off with the bags and the sacred power within. Coming back the women could hear the men singing and dancing and realised what happened. Not a loss at this they allowed men to continue to control the ceremonies as women already have the ultimate power; to conceive and bear life; men merely imitate it.\r\n\r\nDhabila\r\nContinuing their sojourn they stopped a little further westward making another Manharrngu place at Dhabila - present site of Ramingining township's barge landing. here on the grassy flood plains they saw and made sacred the Buwata-Bustard/Plains Turkey.\r\nFrom here they disappeared into the sunset in the west. Malangi paints the steps to the story at Dhamala and has inhereted the responsibility for Dhabila since his brother died in 1982. Dorrng paints the Djang'kawu at Gariyak; either the sacred waterholes or body design. The actions of the Djang'kawu Sisters are celebrated in the Ngarra ceremony today.\r\n\r\nRAMINGINING\r\nRamingining is a small community of around 590 people, of whom about 30 are non-Aboriginal people, mostly advisors or teacherrs of some sort or another. The village itself is located some 400 kms to the east of Darwin, and nearly 30 kms from the Arafura Sea. It is a relatively new settlement, having only been established in the early 1970's. \r\n\r\nEarlier, in the 1960's an outstation of Milingimbi was set up at Nangalalala [ 8 kms N/E of Ramingining], a kilometre or so from the Glyde River. Ther older settlement Milingimbi Mission, was established in 1926 and is in fact situated on an island a few kilometres off the north Australia coastline. Nangala is still in existence, and is now considered an outstation of Ramingining.\r\nThe area around Ramingining on the mainland is home for the Djinang speaking Wurrkigenydjarr/Marrangu, Wulaki, Mildjingi, Balmbi and Murrungun clans.  In a wider circle are the Burarra, Rembarrnga, Wudamin, Ganalbingu and Manharrngu peoples. To the north are the Gorryindi, Gamalangga, Malarra and Walamangu peoples who look after the Crocodile Islands. Other people who live there and have ceremonial connections are members of the Gupapuyngu, Djambarrpuyngu, Wagilag, Liyagalawumir and Liya-gawumirr groups.  \r\nThe particular tract of land upon which Ramingining township is built is owned by the Djadawitjibi people, of the Djiang group. Their principal creative being is Garrtjambal, the kangaroo.\r\nSome 10-20 kms to the south of the village of Ramingining, where the looping Glyde River becomes the Goyder, is the large Arafura Swamp. Some 250 sq kms in area, this unique fresh water environment is home for an innumerable variety of water birds (including gurramatji, the magpie goose), fresh water plants, fields of water lilies, crocodiles, water snakes, insect life, and the magnificent and rare Corypha elata palm. (hundred year palm?).\r\nRamingining is situated upon the richest bauxite deposit (outside Nhuunboy) in Australia, possibly the world. The missionaries realised this and deliberately established the community at the present site to thwart mining company development and associated problems as present in Nhulunboy.\r\n\r\nThe Art\r\nThe art of Ramingining has always been highly prized and is still today pursued by some of the best known living artists in Arnhemland Land. However until the 70's, when the settlement of Ramingining was established, most of the art work of this area was circulated to the outside world either through the Art Centre at Milingimbi, or the Government settlement of Maningrida, some 80 kms to the west towards Darwin.\r\nNow the Art Centre at Ramingining has come into its own; somewhat ironically, it now services the older settlement at Milingimbi. The result of this change in the last decade is that now all art is chanelled beyond the region of its production through the Ramingining community's own Art Co-operative, Bulabula Arts.\r\nThis is a locally owned and controlled artists co-operative whose role is to 'market' the work of local painters, weavers, and sculptors to the outside world. The responsibility of the Centre is to show the works with the status and respect they deserve, and to show other people Aboriginal culture, in a way that may educate them.\r\n\r\nOrigins\r\nEvery Aboriginal person comes from a creator being, known as wangarr, in this region. These spiritual beings took many forms, moving across the land and sea, forming and shaping the landscape.\r\nAs these beings travelled they imparted the 'life force' in that place for the Aboriginal people who were affiliated to that 'country' or land tract. They gave the people their langauages, songs, ceremonies, law, social customs, and technology. Always they wore the proper body ornaments and carried with them the life-giving rranga, sacred images of the wangarr, and girri, the wordly posessions each person needed for survival. They also gave each person/group their land." .
