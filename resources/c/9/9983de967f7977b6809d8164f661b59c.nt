<https://colonial-heritage.triply.cc/nmvw/id/object/RV-IB-U-V80.016> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The artist\r\n\r\nBorn about 1890 in Yeiimpi, eastern Melville Island, as a teenager Lamurautemirri worked on Melville Island as a skinner for the white buffalo-shooter Joel Cooper and later at various locations on Melville as a labourner for the itinerant timber-butter Sam Green and his successors. Cooper's main camp was at Paru, south-western Melville, across the Apsley Strait from Bathurst Island Mission at Nguiu.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1920s, the timber-cutters having abandoned their operations, the artist paddled over to Darwin in a dugout canoe and obtained work chopping firewood for a private household, but soon returned to Yeiimpi to resume a traditional existence. Later in the 'twenties he worked as a deckhand on the Australian naval vessel Geranium which was charting the waters around Bathurst and Melville Islands.\r\n\r\nHe spent most of the 1930s living traditionally on Melville Island. In 1942 when he was staying at Paru, Japanese aircraft strafed Nguiu on their way to bomb Darwin. Fearing Japanese soldiers would return and shoot the Tiwi Lamurautemirri and others spent most of the War years in the bush with occasional visits to Nguiu. At War's end the artist returned to Paru where he lived with his three wives until his death in 1974.\r\nLean and fit to the end of his days, Lamurautemirri was an acclaimed singer at the then-annual Kulama ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe carving\r\n\r\nThe artist has carved a representation in miniature of a Pukumani mortuary post. The features of a female figure have been carved into the post. The piece has been painted with traditional Tiwi ceremonial design, and the woman has seized a yintiyintinga (ceremonial goose-feather beard worn by male participants) and tied it to her face as she dances.\r\n\r\nThis piece was carved for Lance Bennett during one of his visits to Bathurst Island in 1965.\r\n\r\ncopyright Lance Bennett" .
