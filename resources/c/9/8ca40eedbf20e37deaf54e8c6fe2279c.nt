<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/54cc38c47c1db5c19f0e21239ec20e2d> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Since 1978 Mark Adams has documented the practice of Samoan tattooists (tufuga tatatau) of the 'aiga Sa Su'a -a titled tattooing\r\nfamily- in a series of portraits of tattood men and 'genre' studies of the operation, set in domestic interiors. The project began with Adams's chance discovery of tattooing among migrant Samoans in suburban Auckland and his triendship with tattoo master Su'a Sulu'ape Paula Il, who agreed to him photographing his work. Paula had immigrated to New Zealand in 1974 and was one of two tattooists working in the country at the time,  who drew their clientele trom a growing population of migrant Samoans who had entered the country's labour markets in the 1960s. TÃ¡tau is an ancient practice in Samoa, where it has continued unbroken - though not unchanged-by European incursions, colonisation or Christian conversion.Traditionally, young men acquired the pe'a, a male body tattoo from the waist to the bottom of the knees, as a rite of passage into manhood- a significance it still to some extent retains (although submitting to the ordeal is strictly voluntary todav). Since the\r\nend of the Second World War, waves of out-migration have formed large communities of Samoans in New Zealand. Australia and the United States. Tufuga tatatau have tollowed this diaspora as either migrants themselves or as itinerant tattooists providing services to a global community. Among Samoans. the pe'a, the malu (a female tattoo) and contemporary , forms of the tradition, like 'sleeves' and ''armbands', have taken on renewed significance as a link to tradition and a statement of ethnic identity. The double portrait is of Jim Taofinu'u. Paulo's brother-in-law., taken in the rufuga's living room in Mangere, South Auckland, in 1985. Like other portraits in the series, its subject wears his tattoo with a beguiling manner-of-factness. a rebuttal to colonial narratives of cultural decline or nostalgic ideals of 'purity'. In many ways the portrait s as much about a place as it is about the tattooed man in the centre. Or rather, it shows them to be inextricably related. Migrants remake foreign spaces into the culturally familiar. Simple things like shell and plasticleis over family photographsm brightly patterned sheets on the furniture and woven pandanus mats on the floor transform the featureless anonymity of a state house into a distinctively Samoan place where ways of being Samoan are being performed every day.\r\n\r\n(Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts, p. 301)" .
