Sports and physically active games were very popular among the Mohaves. In promoting fitness and stamina they prepared boys and men to become strong warriors. The Mohaves played a number of different ballgames. Kickball consisted of a race during which runners kicked a small ball forward for miles, competing against each other for speed and stamina. For ball-slinging they used flexible willow poles with which balls of clay were slung at opponents, an equivalent of a mock battle. When the white newcomers introduced soccer, the game was readily accepted by the Mohaves and many other Indian tribes. However, shinny (oohkáhnk) as witnessed by Ten Kate was traditionally the most popular sport, and was played by both sexes. The Mohaves, Quechans, and Walapais used curved stick, the Cocopas straight sticks to play the game (Culin 1907:644-646; Devereux 1950; Gifford 1933:281-282).\r\n\tRMV 362-107 is rather worn and slightly egg-shaped ball, stuffed with blue wool cloth. The hide cover is stitched with heavy cotton thread. RMV 362-108 is round, filled with cotton cloth, covered with a sewn and woven mesh of braded cotton thread. It seems that four lateral segments are deliberately stained as decoration.\r\n(Hovens 2007-08)\r\n\r\n\r\nBal in gebruik bij het oekánk spel, met een netwerk van katoenen draden omgeven." .
