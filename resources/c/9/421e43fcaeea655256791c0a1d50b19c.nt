Abelam men describe these sacred instruments as “the voices of the Nngwal” and the children of spiritual beings created in the ceremonies. \r\nOrigins myth:\r\nThe myth of their origins accounts a story of some young men who fell asleep near pools of water inhabited by Wale – the water spirits.  They dreamed about the sound and the shape of these instruments and on awakening knew how to make them.  Water in Abelam and Arapesh cultures bears associations with femininity, procreation, birth and death, and the myth of the origins of musical instruments exemplifies the transmutation of these symbols  from female to male domain" .
