The village itself is located some 400 kms to the east of Darwin, and nearly 30 kms from the Arafura Sea. It is a relatively new settlement, having only been established in the early 1970's. \r\n\r\nEarlier, in the 1960's an outstation of Milingimbi was set up at Nangalalala [ 8 kms N/E of Ramingining], a kilometre or so from the Glyde River. Ther older settlement Milingimbi Mission, was established in 1926 and is in fact situated on an island a few kilometres off the north Australia coastline. Nangala is still in existence, and is now considered an outstation of Ramingining.\r\nThe area around Ramingining on the mainland is home for the Djinang speaking Wurrkigenydjarr/Marrangu, Wulaki, Mildjingi, Balmbi and Murrungun clans.  In a wider circle are the Burarra, Rembarrnga, Wudamin, Ganalbingu and Manharrngu peoples. To the north are the Gorryindi, Gamalangga, Malarra and Walamangu peoples who look after the Crocodile Islands. Other people who live there and have ceremonial connections are members of the Gupapuyngu, Djambarrpuyngu, Wagilag, Liyagalawumir and Liya-gawumirr groups.  \r\nThe particular tract of land upon which Ramingining township is built is owned by the Djadawitjibi people, of the Djiang group. Their principal creative being is Garrtjambal, the kangaroo.\r\nSome 10-20 kms to the south of the village of Ramingining, where the looping Glyde River becomes the Goyder, is the large Arafura Swamp. Some 250 sq kms in area, this unique fresh water environment is home for an innumerable variety of water birds (including gurramatji, the magpie goose), fresh water plants, fields of water lilies, crocodiles, water snakes, insect life, and the magnificent and rare Corypha elata palm. (hundred year palm?)." .
